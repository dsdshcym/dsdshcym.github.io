<p>
Just like <a href="https://yiming.dev/blog/2019/11/01/every-business-is-a-relationships-business-million-dollar-consulting-review/">consulting</a>, management is also about people.
It's about relationship between you and your direct reports.
It's about building trust between you and your direct reports.
</p>

<p>
<i>Care Personally</i> and <i>Challenge Directly</i> are the two essential skills to build this trust.
And they are not only for bosses.
Read it if you want to build healthy work relationships!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8b2a3aa">
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>refactoring is about changing the structure of the code <b>without</b> changing its observable behavior.</li>
<li>the observable behavior of code depends on who is doing the observing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>when we change a public interface — as long as we control all the calling code — we can safely refactor.</li>
<li>If we have a published interface, however, we do not have control over the code that observes the behavior of our code. And there we cannot safely refactor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
I've seen so many times when people misuse the word "refactor".
People often use "refactoring" as a shorthand for "changing code".
Sometimes this "refactoring" would change the behaviour of our code, and more often than not, change the behaviour of the part we don't want to touch.
So it's safer to refactor our code without changing its behaviour.
And by doing so, we can move faster in smaller steps.

A great introduction to Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) theory.
I've found that JTBD theory very similar to OKR.
I think in the end, they are all variants of scientific method:

<p>
My biggest take-away from this article is that:
<b>different stages of failure need different solutions.</b>
</p>

<p>
When facing a management problem or a engineering problem, we should also think about its stage, and use the suitable solution.

<p>
I used Tailwind CSS in a project and found it really pleasant to use.
This article is the rationale behind the design of Tailwind CSS.
</p>

<p>
And it reminded me of <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">The Wrong Abstraction — Sandi Metz</a>.
There are tons of wrong abstractions I've seen in our CSS files.
So maybe we should really think about the dependency direction first and hold off before we de-duplicate our style sheets.
</p>

<p>
One scenario that Utility classes framework doesn't work well is static sites, especially static blogs.
And this scenario is well-suited for traditional CSS classes, because blogs need restyleable HTML, not reusable CSS.
When world-wide web first started, this kind of static sites is the majority of Internet.
So it made perfect sense to have the traditional CSS classes architecture.
</p>

<p>
But for most modern applications, the HTML markups are not independent, i.e. most components' structure and style are highly coupled by nature.
So Utility classes framework is a perfect fit.
It provides reusable and composable CSS classes as a intermediate layer between our applications and the vanilla "magical" CSS.
</p>

<p>
In 2020, I'm definitely gonna learn and use Tailwind in my side-projects.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What's a "pool"?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A pool is an investment the organization decides to make to get value within a particular topic</li>
<li>instead of telling what kind of final effect you want first (and then estimate effort to get it done), you'll telling how much you'd like to spend (and then make the best effort to reap value out of the investment).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Working with pools is the quintessence of Agility:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"understandability" of items (expressing them in the ubiquitous language) from the outline boosts transparency</li>
<li>fine-grained split assures that our product is technically in a releasable state nearly all the time</li>
<li>no fixed plan provides the flexibility of choice - especially valuable when some of your initial assumptions have failed and a little pivot is required</li>
<li>the concept of the pool (&amp; its size) helps with prioritizing topics &amp; investments in them - e.g. more important topics before less important ones or topic X getting twice as big pool as Y, because it is expected to deliver more value</li>

<p>
The 25% limit is for developing the same features.
To really speed things up, we need to cut features and prioritize.
