<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0f6c3f7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>XP addresses both technique and good relationships for you to be successful
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good relationships
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The more humanely I treated myself and others, the more productive we all
became</li>
<li>XP is an attempt to reconcile humanity and productivity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Technique
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Technique supports trust relationships
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you can accurately estimate your work, deliver quality the first
time, and create rapid feedback loops; then you can be a trustworthy
partner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>XP demands that participants learn a high level of technique in service of
the team's goals</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>XP can be described this way
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Lightweight</dt><dd>only do what you need to do to creat value for the customer</dd>
<dt>A methodology based on addressing constraints in software development</dt><dd>but different team does XP differently</dd>
<dt>Can work with teams of any size</dt><dd>the values and principles behind XP are applicable at any scale</dd>
<dt>Adapts to vague or rapidly changing requirements</dt><dd></dd>
</dl></li>
<li>XP is a software development discipline that addresses risk at all levels of
the development process.</li>
<li>What is XP?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>XP is giving up old, ineffective technical and social habits in favor of new
ones that work.</li>
<li>XP is fully appreciating yourself for total effort today.</li>
<li>XP is striving to do better tomorrow.</li>
<li>XP is evaluating yourself by your contribution to the team's shared goals.</li>
<li>XP is asking to get some of your human needs met through software
development.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Values, Principles, and Practices
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Knowledge and understanding <i>practices</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Practices are clear and objective</li>
<li>Practices give you a place to start (before you understand software
development in a deeper way)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Knowledge and understanding <i>values</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Values are the roots of the things we like and don't like in a situation</li>
<li>Values are the large-scale criteria we use to judge what we see, think, and
do</li>
<li>Values bring purpose to practices.</li>
<li>Practices are evidence of values.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Communicating in the most effective way I can shows I value communication</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practices bring accountability to values
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Practices are clear</li>
<li>Values are fuzzy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Principles bridge the gap between values and practices</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How to be an extreme programmer
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Program in the extreme style</li>
<li>Participate in the community of people who share these values and at least
some of your practices</li>
<li>Share what you know with others</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgeef0aac" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgeef0aac">Chapter 4. Values</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeef0aac">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>different people values different things</li>
<li>XP embraces 5 values to guide development
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Communication
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>matters the most</li>
<li>motion without communicating is not progress</li>
<li>ask if the problem was caused by a lack of communication</li>
<li>communication is important for creating a sense of team and effective cooperation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simplicity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ask "What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?"</li>
<li>Simplicity only makes sense in context</li>
<li>The values balance and support each other
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Improving communication helps achieve simplicity by eliminating unneeded or deferrable requirements from today's concerns</li>
<li>Achieving simplicity gives you that much less to communicate about</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Feedback
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Wouldn't it be easier just to do it right in the first place?"
-&gt; <b>Being satisfied with improvement rather than expecting instant perfection</b>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We may not know how to do it "right".</li>
<li>What's right for today may be wrong for tomorrow.</li>
<li>Doing everything "right" today might take so long that changing
circumstances tomorrow invalidate today's solution before it is even
finished.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Feedback forms
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Opinions about an idea, yours or your teammates'</li>
<li>How the code looks when you implement the idea</li>
<li>Whether the tests were easy to write</li>
<li>Whether the tests run</li>
<li>How the idea works once it has been deployed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>The sooner you know, the sooner you can adapt.</b></li>
<li>Too much feedback
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the team is ignoring important feedback; it needs to slow down</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Connections with other values
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Feedback is a critical part of communication.</li>
<li>Feedback also contributes to simplicity.</li>
<li>The simpler the system, the easier it is to get feedback about it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Courage
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Courage is effective action in the face of fear.</li>
<li>Connections with other values
Courage as a primary value without counterbalancing values is dangerous.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The courage to speak truths, pleasant or unpleasant, fosters
communication and trust.</li>
<li>The courage to discard failing solutions and seek new ones encourages
simplicity.</li>
<li>The courage to seek real, concrete answers creates feedback.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Respect
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Respect each other</li>
<li>Respect the project</li>
<li>No one is intrinsically worth more than anyone else.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Others
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your organization, your team, and you yourself may choose other values</li>
<li>What is most important is <b>aligning team behavior to team values.</b></li>
</ul></li>

<div id="outline-container-orgf6707ff" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf6707ff">Chapter 5. Principles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf6707ff">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why do we need principles?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Values are too abstract to directly guide behavior</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Principles that guide XP
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Humanity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do people need to be good developers?
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Basic safety</dt><dd>freedom from hunger, physical harm, and threats to loved
ones. Fear of job loss threatens this need.</dd>
<dt>Accomplishment</dt><dd>the opportunity and ability to contribute to their
society.</dd>
<dt>Belonging</dt><dd>the ability to identify with a group from which they receive
validation and accountability and contribute to its shared
goals.</dd>
<dt>Growth</dt><dd>the opportunity to expand their skills and perspective.</dd>
<dt>Intimacy</dt><dd>the ability to understand and be understood deeply by others.</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Part of the challenge of team software development is <i>balancing the needs
of the individual with the needs of the team</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The magic of great teams is that after the team members develop trust
they find that <b>they are free to be <i>more</i> themselves as a result of
their work together</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Economics
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Make sure what you are doing has business value, meets business goals,
and serves business needs</b></li>
<li>2 aspects of economics that affect software development
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The time value of money
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow (Development is
more valuable when it <b>earns money sooner and spends money later</b>)</li>
<li>Incremental design explicitly <b>defers design investment until the
last responsible moment</b> in an effort to spend money later</li>
<li><i>Pay-per-use</i> provides a way of realizing revenue from features as
soon as they are deployed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The option value of systems and teams
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reusable software is more valuable than non-reusable software</li>
<li>Keep in mind the time value of money by <b>not investing in speculative
flexibility</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mutual Benefit
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>The computer business is really a people business</b> and maintaining
working relationships is important</li>
<li>Communication-with-the-future problem
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Extensive internal documentation is an example of violating mutual
benefit</li>
<li>XP solves it in mutually beneficial ways:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Automated tests</li>
<li>Refactor to remove accidental complexity</li>
<li>Choose names from a coherent and explicit set of metaphors</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mutual benefit in XP is searching for practices that <b>benefit me now, me
later, and my customer as well</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Self-Similarity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try copying the structure of one solution into a new context, even at
different scales
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>TDD at different scales</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Just because you copy a structure that works in one context doesn't mean
it will work in another. It is a good place to start, though.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Improvement
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In software development, "perfect" is a verb, not an adjective
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No perfect process -&gt; Perfect your process</li>
<li>No perfect design -&gt; Perfect your design</li>
<li>No perfect stories -&gt; Perfect your stories</li>
</ul></li>
<li>XP doesn't mean waiting for perfection in order to begin
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Do the best you can today</li>
<li>Striving for awareness and understanding necessary to do better
tomorrow</li>
</ol></li>
<li><b>The key to improvement is using newfound technological efficiency to
enable new, more effective social relationships</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Diversity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How do you choose between two solutions?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two ideas about a design present an opportunity, not a problem.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>work together on the problem</li>
<li>both opinions should be valued</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Resolve conflicts productively
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>respecting others and maintaining myself smooths communication in
times of stress</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reflection
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good teams think about
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>how</i> they are working</li>
<li><i>why</i> they are working</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Reflection should not be limited to "official" opportunities</li>
<li>Reflection isn't a purely intellectual exercise
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Analyze data</li>
<li>Learn from your gut ("negative" emotions)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Reflection comes after action
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't take reflection too far</li>
<li>Software development has a long tradition of people so busy thinking
about software development they don't have time to develop software.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Flow (CI/CD)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Deliver a steady flow of valuable software by engaging in all the
activities of development simultaneously.</li>
<li>XP is biased towards <b>a continuous flow of activities</b> rather than
discrete phases.</li>
<li>The more things are deferred, the larger the chunk, the higher the risk.</li>
<li>Resolve the problems that disrupted your flow and get back to weekly deployment as soon as you can.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Opportunity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>See problems as opportunities for change.</li>
<li>Part of being extreme is consciously choosing to transform each problem
into an opportunity: <b>an opportunity for personal growth, deepening
relationships, and improved software.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Redundancy
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The critical, difficult problems in software development should be
solved several different ways.</li>
<li>While redundancy can be wasteful, be careful not to remove redundancy
that serves a valid purpose.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Failure
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Failure may not be avoidable waste.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Failure can impart knowledge</li>
<li>Knowledge is valuable and sometimes hard to come by.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fail instead of talk</li>
<li><b>When you don't know what to do though, risking failure can be the
shortest, surest road to success.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quality
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sacrificing quality is not effective as a means of control.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Projects don't go faster by accepting lower quality. -&gt; lowering
quality standards often results in later, less predictable delivery.</li>
<li>Projects don't go slower by demanding higher quality. -&gt; Pushing
quality higher often results in faster delivery</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quality isn't a purely economic factor. (but also a humanity factor)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People need to do work they are proud of.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>XP chooses <b>scope</b> (instead of quality) as the primary means of
planning, tracking, and steering projects.</li>
<li>A concern for quality is no excuse for inaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Baby Steps
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"What's the least you could do that is recognizably in the right
direction?"</li>
<li>The overhead of small steps is much less than when a team wastefully
recoils from aborted big changes.</li>
<li>Practices
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>TDD</li>
<li>CI/CD</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Accepted Responsibility
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Responsibility cannot be assigned; it can only be accepted.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Conclusion
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The principles give you a better idea of what the practice is intended to
accomplish.</li>
<li>Understanding the principles gives you the opportunity to create practices
that work in harmony with your existing practices and your overall goals.</li>

<li>Different perspectives
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>Two sets of tests in XP

<li><b>Beta testing is a symptom of weak testing practices and poor communication

<li><b>The physical metaphor behind the word "testing" is misleading</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because software is a virtual world, <b>"testing" before or after makes equal
sense</b></li>

<li>Tests can provide a measure of progress</li>

Software elements can be replicated endlessly at no cost

<p>
In ten years the pendulum has swung from 'design everything' to 'design
nothing.' But the alternative to BDUF [Big Design Up Front] isn't no design up
front, it's a Little Design Up Front (LDUF) or Enough Design Up Front (ENUF).

<li>We are often writing applications for the first time
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>There is an art to designing just enough to get feedback, and then using
that feed back to improve the design enough to get the next round of
feedback</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are usually many designs that are good enough for the software to be
successful.
