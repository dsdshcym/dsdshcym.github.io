<li>The key to controlling complexity is a good domain model,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a model that goes beyond a surface vision of a domain by
introducing an underlying structure,</li>
<li>which gives the software developers the leverage they need.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>You shouldn't separate the concepts from the implementation</b>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>you cannot build a useful conceptual model without considering
implementation issues.</li>
<li>The greatest value of a domain model is that it provides a
<b>ubiquitous language</b> that ties domain experts and technologists
together.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><b>Domain models aren't first modeled and then implemented.</b>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the really powerful domain models evolve over time</li>

technical vocabulary for discussing domain design.

<h3 id="org97b2589">The Challenge of Complexity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org97b2589">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>The approach to design largely determines how complex software can
become</b></li>
<li><b>The most significant complexity of many applications is in the
domain itself</b>, the activity or business of the user, (not
technical).</li>
<li>The premise of this book:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For most software projects, the primary focus should be on the
domain and domain logic.</li>
<li>Complex domain designs should be based on a model.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Domain-driven design, aimed at accelerating software projects that have to
deal with complicated domains, is both
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>a way of thinking</li>
<li>a set of priorities,</li>

<h3 id="orgd3ca068">Design Versus Development Process</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3ca068">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Design and process are inextricable
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When people learn design techniques, they feel excited by the
possibilities. Then the messy realities of a real project descend
on them.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>They can't fit the new design ideas with the technology they
must use.</li>
<li>They don't know when to let go of a particular design aspect in
the interest of time and when to dig in their heels and find a
clean solution.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Two (Agile) practices are prerequisites for applying the approach
in this book.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Development is iterative</i></li>
<li><i>Developers and domain experts have a close relationship</i></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, 2nd Edition</li>
<li>This book intertwines design and development practice and
<b>illustrates how domain-driven design and Agile development
reinforce each other</b>.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A sophisticated approach to domain modeling within the context
of an Agile development process will accelerate development.</li>
<li>The interrelationship of process with domain development makes
this approach more practical than any treatment of "pure"
design in a vacuum.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>although fear of unanticipated requirements often leads to
over-engineering, the attempt to avoid over-engineering can develop
into another fear: <b>a fear of doing any deep design thinking at
all</b>.</li>
<li>XP works best for developers with a sharp design sense
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>past design choices make refactoring itself either easier or
harder</li>
<li>model and design choices clarify or confuse communication</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgde58519">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Domain-driven design is a difficult technical challenge that can pay
off big, opening opportunities just when most software projects
begin to ossify into legacy.</li>
<li>The biggest gains come when a team joins together to apply a
domain-driven design approach and to move the domain model to the
project's center of discourse.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the team members will share a language that enriches their
communication and keeps it connected to the software.</li>
<li>They will produce a lucid implementation in step with a model,
giving leverage to application development.</li>
<li>They will share a map of how the design work of different teams
relates, and they will systematically focus attention on the
features that are most distinctive and valuable to the
organization.</li>

What is a Model?
</p>
<pre class="example">
18th century Chinese map is a wrong model of this world
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>A model is a selectively simplified and consciously structured form
of knowledge</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An appropriate model makes sense of information and focuses it on
a problem</li>
<li>Different forms of a model
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A diagram</li>
<li>Carefully written code</li>
<li>An English sentence</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Domain modeling is not a matter of making as "realistic" a model as
possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Utility of a Model in DDD
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The model and the heart of the design shape each other</li>
<li>The model is the backbone of a language used by all team members</li>
<li>The model is distilled knowledge</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Heart of Software
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The heart of software is its ability to solve domain-related
problems for its user</li>
<li>There are systematic ways of thinking that developers can employ
to search for insight and produce effective models.</li>

<h3 id="orgbb12b51">Chapter One. Crunching Knowledge</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbb12b51">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Real-world Example (PCB)
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>They (PCB designers) constantly corrected me, and as they did I
started to learn. We ironed out collisions and ambiguities in
their terminology and differences between their technical
opinions, and they learned. They began to explain things more
precisely and consistently, and we started to develop a model
together.</li>
<li>As the (PCB) engineers described new features they needed, I made
them walk me through scenarios of how the objects
interacted. When the model objects couldn't carry us through an
important scenario, we brainstormed new ones or changed old ones,
crunching their knowledge. We refined the model; the code
coevolved. A few months later the PCB engineers had a rich tool
that exceeded their expectations.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Ingredients of Effective Modeling
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Binding the model and the implementation</li>
<li>Cultivating a language based on the model</li>
<li>Developing a knowledge-rich model
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The objects had behavior and enforced rules.</li>
<li>The model wasn't just a data schema; it was integral to
solving a complex problem.</li>
<li>It captured knowledge of various kinds.</li>

<h4 id="orga9e5759">Knowledge Crunching</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga9e5759">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Effective domain modelers are knowledge crunchers.</b></li>
<li>Knowledge crunching is not a solitary activity.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A team of developers and domain experts collaborate,</li>
<li>typically led by developers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Waterfall method completely lacks feedback
</p>
<pre class="example">
The analysts have full responsibility for creating the model, based
only on input from the business experts. They have no opportunity to
learn from the programmers or gain experience with early versions of
software. Knowledge trickles in one direction, but does not
accumulate.
</pre></li>
<li>Other projects use an iterative process, but they fail to build up
knowledge because they don't abstract.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>If programmers are not interested in the domain, they learn only
what the application should do, not the principles behind it.</b></li>
<li>Useful software can be built that way, but the project will
never arrive at a point where powerful new features unfold as
corollaries to older features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Without collaboration with domain experts, the concepts
(abstracted by programmers) are naive
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That shallowness of knowledge produces software that does a
basic job but lacks a deep connection to the domain expert's way
of thinking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The interaction between team members changes as all members crunch
the model together.
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Because analysts and programmers are feeding into it</dt><dd>it is cleanly organized and abstracted, so it can provide
leverage for the implementation.</dd>
<dt>Because the domain experts are feeding into it</dt><dd>the model reflects deep knowledge of the business.</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>As the model improves, it becomes <b>a tool for organizing the
information that continues to flow through the project</b>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6b1c7f5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we set out to write software, we never know enough.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>we don't realize how much we don't know</b> -&gt; domains that seem
less technically daunting can be deceiving</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All projects leak knowledge, and the knowledge is fragmented
again.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>People who have learned something move on.</li>
<li>Reorganization scatters the team</li>
<li>Crucial subsystems are out-sourced in such a way that code is
delivered but knowledge isn't.</li>
<li>With typical design approaches, the code and documents don't
express this hard-earned knowledge in a usable form, so <b>when
the oral tradition is interrupted for any reason</b>, the
knowledge is lost.</li>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Technical knowledge</li>
<li>General domain-modeling skills</li>

<li>Business <b>activities</b> and <b>rules</b> are as central to a domain as are
the entities involved (<i>the nouns</i>)</li>
<li>Example: Extracting a Hidden Concept
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Overbooking in the shipping industry</li>
<li><b>An important business rule may be hidden as a guard clause</b> in an
application method
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>As written, it is unlikely that any business expert could read
this code to verify the rule, even with the guidance of a
developer.</li>
<li>It would be difficult for a technical, non-businessperson to
connect the requirement text with the code.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Focus on the important rules and minimize or separate everything
else.</li>
<li>The more explicit design has these advantages:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In order to bring the design to this stage, the programmers and
everyone else involved will have come to understand the nature
of overbooking as a distinct and important business rule, not
just an obscure calculation.</li>
<li>Programmers can show business experts technical artifacts, even
code, that should be intelligible to domain experts (with
guidance), thereby closing the feedback loop.</li>

communication within the team and in the code.</li>

<li><p>
Without Layers
</p>
<pre class="example">
In an object-oriented program, UI, database, and other support code
often gets written directly into the business objects. Additional
business logic is embedded in the behavior of UI widgets and data-base
scripts. This happens because it is the easiest way to make things
work, in the short run.
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implementing coherent, model-driven objects becomes impractical.</li>
<li>With all the technologies and logic involved in each activity, a
program must be kept very simple or it becomes impossible to
understand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Any element of a layer depends only on other elements in the same
layer or on elements of the layers "beneath" it.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Communication upward must pass through some indirect mechanism</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The value of layers is that <b>each (layer) specializes in a
particular aspect</b> of a computer program.</li>
<li>Most successful architectures use some version of these four
conceptual layers:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>UI (Presentation Layer)</li>
<li>Application Layer</li>
<li>Domain Layer (Model Layer)</li>
<li>Infrastructure Layer</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Separating the domain layer from the infrastructure and user
interface layers allows <b>a much cleaner design of each layer</b>.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>The infrastructure layer (services)

<li>Simplify the application layer</li>
<li>The application layer only needs to know <i>when</i> to send a

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Architectural Frameworks
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The best architectural frameworks solve complex technical problems
while allowing the domain developer to concentrate on expressing a
model.</li>
<li>But frameworks can easily get in the way,
<ol class="org-ol">

design choices</li>
<li>or by making the implementation so heavyweight that development

<li>When to use Domain-Driven Design?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Domain-driven design pays off best for ambitious projects, and it

</ul></li>
<li>What is SMART UI? (<b>The Default Rails Stack</b>)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Put all the business logic into the user interface.</li>
<li>Chop the application into small functions and implement them as
separate user interfaces, embedding the business rules into them.</li>
<li>Use a relational database as a shared repository of the data.</li>
<li>Use the most automated UI building and visual programming tools
available.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pros &amp; Cons
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Advantages
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Productive</li>
<li>Less capable developers can work this way with little training</li>
<li>Even deficiencies in requirements analysis can be overcome by
releasing a prototype to users and then quickly changing the
product to fit their requests</li>
<li>Applications are decoupled from each other
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Delivery schedules of small modules can be planned
relatively accurately</li>
<li>Expanding the system with additional, simple behavior can be
easy</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Relational databases work well and provide integration at the
data level</li>
<li>4GL tools work well</li>
<li>When applications are hand off, maintenance programmers will be
able to quickly redo portions they can't figure out, because
the effects of the changes should be localized to each
particular UI</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Disadvantages
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Integration of applications is difficult except through the
database</li>
<li>There is no reuse of behavior and no abstraction of the
business problem - Business rules have to be duplicated in each
operation to which they apply</li>
<li>Rapid prototyping and iteration reach a natural limit because
the lack of abstraction limits refactoring options</li>
<li>Complexity buries you quickly, so the growth path is strictly
toward additional simple applications
(<b>micro-services?</b>). There is no graceful path to richer
behavior</li>
<li><b>You can't migrate to another design approach except by
replacing entire applications.</b></li>
<li>Just using a flexible language doesn't create a flexible
system, but it may well produce an expensive one.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the architecture isolates the domain-related code in a way that
<b>allows a cohesive domain design loosely coupled to the rest of the
system</b>, then that architecture can probably support domain-driven
design.</li>

<li><b>The first step is to somehow represent the essential concepts of the
domain in the model.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many transformations of domain models and the corresponding code
happen when developers recognize a concept that has been hinted at
in discussion or present implicitly in the design, and they then
represent it explicitly in the model with one or more objects or
relationships.</li>

argument. But blocks are a basic library type in Smalltalk, so they
don't add to the developer's mental load. Because the return value
matches the implementer, they can be strung together, like a series of
filters. They are easy to write and easy to read. They do not
introduce extraneous concepts that are irrelevant to the problem of
selecting subsets.

<li>Exploration Teams

<dt>Self-determination</dt><dd>A small team can be assembled on the fly to explore a design
problem. The team can operate for a few days and then
disband. There is no need for long-term, elaborate
organizational structures.</dd>
<dt>Scope and sleep</dt><dd>Two or three short meetings spaced out over a few days should
produce a design worth trying. Dragging it out doesn't help. If
you get stuck, you may be taking on too much at once. Pick a
smaller aspect of the design and focus on that.</dd>
<dt>Exercising the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE</dt><dd>Involving the other team members—particularly the subject
matter expert—in the brain-storming session creates an
opportunity to exercise and refine the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE. The
end result of the effort is a refinement of that LANGUAGE which
the original developer(s) will take back and formalize in code.</dd>

<li>Timing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>If you wait until you can make a complete justification for a

<li>Most project teams are still too cautious about <i>continuous
refactoring</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They see the risk of changing code and the cost of developer
time to make a change;</li>
<li>but what's harder to see is <b>the risk of keeping an awkward
design</b> and <b>the cost of working around that design</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Refactoring toward deeper insight needs to become part of the
ongoing exploration of the subject matter of the domain, the
education of the developers, and the meeting of the minds of
developers and domain experts.</li>
<li>Refactor when:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The design does not express the team's current understanding of
the domain;</li>
<li>Important concepts are implicit in the design (and you see a
way to make them explicit); or</li>
<li>You see an opportunity to make some important part of the
design suppler.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This aggressive attitude does not justify any change at any time.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Don't refactor the day before a release.</li>
<li>Don't introduce "supple designs" that are just demonstrations
of technical virtuosity but fail to cut to the core of the
domain.</li>
<li>Don't introduce a "deeper model" that you couldn't convince a
domain expert to use, no matter how elegant it seems.</li>
<li>Don't be absolute about things, but push beyond the comfort
zone in the direction of favoring refactoring.</li>

subdomain generic, because the specification is being passed
outside.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Still requires time from the core team, because the
interface, coding standards, and any other important aspects
need to be communicated.</li>
<li>Incurs significant overhead of transferring ownership back
inside, because code has to be understood. (Still, overhead
is less than for specialized subdomains, because a generic
model presumably requires no special background to
understand.)</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>those specialized models are even more valuable than the
generic ones.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Project Risk Management
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Agile processes typically call for managing risk by tackling the
riskiest tasks early.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>XP specifically calls for getting an end-to-end system up and
running immediately.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Projects face risk from both sides
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>technical risks</li>
<li>domain modeling risks
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>It is easy to underestimate the domain modeling risk.</b>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>unforeseen complexity</li>
<li>inadequate access to business experts</li>
<li>gaps in key skills of the developers</li>
</ol></li>
<li>except when the team has proven skills and the domain is very
familiar, <b>the first-cut system should be based on some part
of the CORE DOMAIN, however simple.</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>the next two patterns, DOMAIN VISION STATEMENT and HIGHLIGHTED CORE,
show how the use of supplemental documents can, with a very minor
investment, improve communication and awareness of the CORE and
focus development effort</li>

<h4 id="orgc529786">Domain Vision Statement</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc529786">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A DOMAIN VISION STATEMENT is modeled after such documents ("vision
statements", layu out the specific value the application will bring
to the organization), but it focuses on the nature of the domain
model and how it is valuable to the enterprise.</li>
<li>Therefore
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Write a short description (about one page) of the CORE DOMAIN and
the value it will bring (the "value proposition")</li>
<li>Show how the domain model serves and balances diverse interests</li>
<li>Keep it narrow</li>
<li>Write this statement early and revise it as you gain new insight</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Examples
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Airline Booking System
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The model can represent passenger priorities and airline
booking strategies and balance these based on flexible
policies. The model of a passenger should reflect the
"relationship" the airline is striving to develop with repeat
customers. Therefore, it should represent the history of the
passenger in useful condensed form, participation in special
programs, affiliation with strategic corporate clients, and so
on.</li>
<li>Different roles of different users (such as passenger, agent,
manager) are represented to enrich the model of relationships
and to feed necessary information to the security framework.</li>
<li>Model should support efficient route/seat search and
integration with other established flight booking systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Semiconductor Factory Automation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The domain model will represent the status of materials and
equipment within a wafer fab in such a way that necessary audit
trails can be provided and automated product routing can be
supported.</li>
<li>The model will not include the human resources required in the
process, but must allow selective process automation through
recipe download.</li>
<li>The representation of the state of the factory should be
comprehensible to human managers, to give them deeper insight
and support better decision making.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>A DOMAIN VISION STATEMENT gives the team <b>a shared direction</b>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3f797be">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The CORE DOMAIN must be made easier to see.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Different people won't pick out quite the same elements, and even
the same person won't be consistent from one day to the next.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Significant structural changes to the code are the ideal way of
identifying the CORE DOMAIN
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>but they are not always practical in the short term</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Two specific techniques can represent this class of solutions.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Distillation Document
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A separate document to describe and explain the CORE DOMAIN.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>three to seven sparse pages</li>
<li>describes the CORE DOMAIN and the primary interactions among
CORE elements</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A distillation document is not a complete design document.</li>
<li>All the usual risks of separate documents apply.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The document may not be maintained.</li>
<li>The document may not be read.</li>
<li>By multiplying the information sources, the document may
defeat its own purpose of cutting through complexity.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The best way to limit these risks is to <b>be absolutely
minimalist</b>.</li>
<li><b>Write the document to be understood by the nontechnical
members of the team.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Flagged CORE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Flag the elements of the CORE DOMAIN within the primary
repository of the model, without particularly trying to
elucidate its role.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Distillation Document as Process Tool
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the distillation document outlines the essentials of the CORE
DOMAIN, then it serves as a practical indicator of the
significance of a model change.</li>
<li>When a model or code change affects the distillation document, it
requires consultation with other team members.</li>
<li>When the change is made, it requires immediate notification of all
team members, and the dissemination of a new version of the
document.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Computations sometimes reach a level of complexity that begins to
bloat the design.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The conceptual "what" is swamped by the mechanistic "how."</li>
<li>A large number of methods that provide algorithms for resolving
the problem obscure the methods that express the problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Therefore
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Partition a conceptually COHESIVE MECHANISM into a separate
lightweight framework.</li>
<li>Particularly watch for formalisms or well-documented categories
of algorithms.</li>
<li>Expose the capabilities of the framework with an
INTENTION-REVEALING INTERFACE.</li>
<li>Now the other elements of the domain can focus on expressing the
problem ("what"), delegating the intricacies of the solution
("how") to the framework.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If this mechanism had been incorporated into the domain model, it
would have cost us in two ways.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The model would have been coupled to a particular method of
solving the problem, limiting future options.</li>
<li>The model of an organization would have been greatly complicated
and muddied.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>GENERIC SUBDOMAIN vs. COHESIVE MECHANISM
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>GENERIC SUBDOMAIN is no different than the CORE DOMAIN, just less
central, less important, less specialized</li>
<li>A COHESIVE MECHANISM does not represent the domain, it solves some
sticky computational problem posed by the expressive models</li>

understood set of elements that can be combined unambiguously to
accomplish complex tasks or express complex information, just as

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Therefore

<li>Refactor the model to <b>separate the CORE concepts from supporting
players</b> (including ill-defined ones) and <b>strengthen the cohesion
of the CORE</b> while <b>reducing its coupling to other code</b>.</li>
<li>Factor all generic or supporting elements into other objects and
place them into other packages, even if this means refactoring the
model in ways that separate highly coupled elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The steps needed to refactor to SEGREGATED CORE are typically
something like these:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Identify a CORE subdomain (possibly drawing from the distillation
document).</li>
<li>Move related classes to a new MODULE, named for the concept that
relates them.</li>
<li>Refactor code to sever data and functionality that are not
directly expressions of the concept. Put the removed aspects into
(possibly new) classes in other packages. Try to place them with
conceptually related tasks, but don't waste too much time being
perfect. Keep focused on scrubbing the CORE subdomain and making
the references from it to other packages explicit and
self-explanatory.</li>
<li>Refactor the newly SEGREGATED CORE MODULE to make its
relationships and interactions simpler and more communicative,
and to minimize and clarify its relationships with other
MODULES. (This becomes an ongoing refactoring objective.)</li>
<li>Repeat with another CORE subdomain until the SEGREGATED CORE is
complete.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Costs of Creating a SEGREGATED CORE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>sometimes in the creation of a SEGREGATED CORE a nicely cohesive

<li>Team members are conscious of the use of language on the project

<li>They are hard to satisfy with the quality of the domain model,
because they keep learning more about the domain. They see
continuous refinement as an opportunity and an ill-fitting model
as a risk.</li>
