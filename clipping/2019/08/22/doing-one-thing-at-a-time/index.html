            <h1>Doing One Thing At A Time</h1>
            <p>
When I started programming, I first learned different Algorithms, Time
Complexity, Big O Notations, etc. Naturally, I was used to analyze the
performance issues when I got a solution.
</p>

<p>
After all these years of coding, I learned that programming is about
doing one thing at a time. Therefore, performance should be a concern
for later (if not last). But I still see a lot of people trying to
optimize their code upfront, or doing multiple things at a time.
</p>

<p>
So this post is about the idea of doing one thing at a time, and why
it is necessary.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org2c34d5d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2c34d5d">Make It Work, Make It Right, Make It Fast</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2c34d5d">
<p>
The best example of doing one thing at a time is the famous quote from
Kent Beck:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">Make It Work Make It Right Make It Fast</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Make It Work</dt><dd>Build the system that can work as specified by the
requirements. The code can be messy. The performance
can be poor.</dd>
<dt>Make It Right</dt><dd>Refactor the code to make the design
right. "Refactor" means that we are not changing
any existing behaviors, so the system is still
working. Still, performance is not the concern here
yet.</dd>
<dt>Make It Fast</dt><dd>Finally, since the system is working and designed
well, we can improve the performance of it more
easily.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
And I favor a rephrased version of this quote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Make it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have
to, make it fast. - Joe Armstrong
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/myelixirstatus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#myelixirstatus</a> <a href="https://t.co/5X8Z3Wr9zQ">pic.twitter.com/5X8Z3Wr9zQ</a></p>&mdash; todd resudek (@sprsmpl) <a href="https://twitter.com/sprsmpl/status/1141088708889722880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
Most of the time, we don't need our program to be fast. The extreme
cases are often rare.
</p>

<p>
Often, we don't need our program to be designed well, neither. We only
need it to work correctly. We can always refactor it later.
</p>

<p>
Even so, making the program work by itself is hard enough. We need to
<a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/05/11/asking-the-right-question/">make the requirements clear</a> to define what it means by "working". We
need to write the program according to these requirements, deploy it,
test it. None of them is easy.
</p>

<p>
Michael Feathers summarized this in a short sentence: <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeWisdom/status/1163792048144732166">“Programming is
the art of doing one thing at a time.”</a>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org6305fe0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6305fe0">Design One Thing At A Time</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6305fe0">
<p>
Doing one thing at a time doesn't only apply to programming. You can
see this philosophy in other activities as well.
</p>

<p>
Take design activities for example, designers can also take several
steps: make it functional, then make it reliable, and finally make it
delightful.
</p>

<p>
Besides this idea in <a href="https://matthewstrom.com/writing/delight-comes-last/">the post</a>, Matthew Ström also gave an explanation
on why people often consider Delight first. Due to this cognitive bias
called Attribute Substitution, people tend to replace a hard question
with a more easily calculated heuristic attribute of the original
question.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When designing, thinking about which font or color to use is
simple. The business-related questions are much harder to reason
about. So designers can fall into this trap.</li>
<li>When programming, performance calculation is universal and familiar
to programmers. The requirements and architectures are different
from project to project, and require a much deeper thinking. So
programmers can fall into this trap too.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To fight this cognitive bias, we need to constantly remind ourselves:
<b>always do one thing at a time.</b>

Jazzwant once said: <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeWisdom/status/1073638879503237120">“Programming is breaking of one big impossible
task into several very small possible tasks.”</a> It's basically the same
idea of doing one thing at a time. And as we can see above, it's the
same for designing process as well. So, can we apply this idea to
everything we do? I think the answer is YES!
</p>

<p>
No matter what kind of products we are building, we can always break
the building process into smaller tasks.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> After that, we focus on
doing each task well and improving them separately. This is how we get
any thing done.

It sounds like Waterfall but it's actually required by any
Agile approach as well. This is a topic for another day.
