<div id="outline-container-org34f6ecf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org34f6ecf">1. Accelerate</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org34f6ecf">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To remain competitive and excel in the market, organizations must
accelerate:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>delivery of goods and services to delight their customers;
engagement with the market to detect and understand customer
demand; anticipation of compliance and regulatory changes that
impact their systems; and response to potential risks such as
security threats or changes in the economy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At the heart of this acceleration is software.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Software and technology are key differentiators for organizations
to deliver value to customers and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Software is transforming and accelerating organizations of all
kinds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is more work to be done than many of us currently believe.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>DevOps is accelerating technology, but that organizations often
overestimate their progress</li>
<li>Executives are especially prone to overestimating their progress
when compared to those who are actually doing the work.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>if we assume the estimates of DevOps maturity or capabilities
from practitioners are more accurate—because they are closer
to the work—the potential for value delivery and growth within
organizations is much greater than executives currently
realize.</li>
<li>the disconnect makes clear the need to measure DevOps
capabilities accurately and to communicate these measurement
results to leaders, who can use them to make decisions and
inform strategy about their organization’s technology posture.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>FOCUS ON CAPABILITIES, NOT MATURITY
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The key to successful change is measuring and understanding the
right things with a focus on capabilities—not on maturity.</li>
<li>Why (Four factors)
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>technology transformations should follow a continuous
improvement paradigm</b>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>maturity models focus on helping an organization "arrive" at
a mature state and then declare themselves done with their
journey</li>
<li>capability models focus on helping an organization
continually improve and progress, realizing that the
technological and business landscape is ever-changing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The most innovative companies and highest-performing
organizations are always striving to be better and never
consider themselves "mature" or "done" with their improvement
or transformation journey</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Teams have their own context, their own systems, their own
goals, and their own constraints, and what we should focus on
next to accelerate our transformation depends on those
things.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>maturity models are quite often a "lock-step" or linear
formula, prescribing a similar set of technologies, tooling,
or capabilities for every set of teams and organizations to
progress through.</li>
<li>capability models are multidimensional and dynamic, allowing
different parts of the organization to take a customized
approach to improvement, and focus on capabilities that will
give them the most benefit based on their current context and
their short and long-term goals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be outcome based
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>capability models focus on key outcomes and how the
capabilities, or levers, drive improvement in those
outcomes
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This provides technical leadership with clear direction and
strategy on high-level goals (with a focus on capabilities to
improve key outcomes).</li>
<li>It also enables team leaders and individual contributors to
set improvement goals related to the capabilities their team
is focusing on for the current time period.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Most maturity models simply measure the technical proficiency
or tooling install base in an organization without tying it
to outcomes.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These are vanity metrics</li>
<li>while they can be relatively easy to measure, they don’t tell
us anything about the impact they have on the business.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The technology and business landscape is ever-changing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>maturity models define a static level of technological,
process, and organizational abilities to achieve.</li>
<li>capability models allow for dynamically changing environments
and allow teams and organizations to focus on developing the
skills and capabilities needed to remain competitive.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>what is good enough and even “high-performing” today is no
longer good enough in the next year.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>By focusing on a capabilities paradigm, organizations can
<b>continuously drive improvement</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>EVIDENCE-BASED TRANSFORMATIONS FOCUS ON KEY CAPABILITIES
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Which capabilities to focus on.</li>
<li><i>Appendix A: Capabilities to Drive Improvement</i></li>
<li>This book will
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>get you started on defining and measuring these capabilities.</li>
<li>point you to some fantastic resources for improving them</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>THE VALUE OF ADOPTING DEVOPS
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in 2017 we found that, when compared to low performers, the high
performers have:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>46 times more frequent code deployments</li>
<li>440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy</li>
<li>170 times faster mean time to recover from downtime</li>
<li>5 times lower change failure rate (1/5 as likely for a change to
fail)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>High performers understand that they don't have to trade speed for
stability or vice versa, because <b>by building quality in they get
both.</b></li>
<li>How do high-performing teams achieve such amazing software
delivery performance?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Turning the right levers</b> / <b>Improving the right capabilities</b></li>

<h3 id="org4d1f56b">2. Measuring Performance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4d1f56b">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>THE FLAWS ON PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two drawbacks in general
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Focus on outputs rather than outcomes</li>
<li>Focus on individual or local measures rather than team or
global ones</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Three examples
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>LoC
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ideally,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We should reward developers for solving business problems
with the minimum amount of code</li>
<li>It's even better if we can solve a problem without writing
code at all or by deleting code (perhaps by a business
process change)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Minimizing LoC isn't an ideal measure either (due to
readability issues)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Velocity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Velocity was designed to be used as a capacity planning tool</li>
<li>Several flaws if used as a productivity metric
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Velocity is a relative and team-dependent measure, not an
absolute one</li>
<li>When used as a productivity measure, teams inevitably work
to game their velocity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Inflate their estimates</li>
<li>Avoid collaborating with other teams (collaboration
might decrease their velocity and increase the other
team's velocity</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Utilization
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High utilization is only good up to a point</li>
<li>Once utilization gets above a certain level, there is no
spare capacity (or "slack") to absorb
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unplanned work</li>
<li>Changes to the plan</li>
<li>Improvement work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Queue theory in Math tells us that ad utilization approaches
100%, lead times approach infinity</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>MEASURING SOFTWARE DELIVERY PERFORMANCE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two key characteristics of a successful measure
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Focus on a global outcome to ensure teams aren't pitted against
each other</li>
<li>Focus on outcomes not output (it shouldn't reward people for
putting in large amounts of busywork that doesn't actually help
achieve organizational goals)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Four measures of delivery performance that meet these two criteria
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Delivery lead time
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The time it takes to go from a customer making a request to
the request being satisfied</li>
<li>A key element of Lean Theory</li>
<li>Two parts to lead time
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The time it takes to design and validate a product or
feature
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's often unclear when to start the clock</li>
<li>Often there is high variability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The time to deliver the feature to customers
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Easier to measure</li>
<li>Has a lower variability</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
The distinction between these two domains

</table></li>
<li>Shorter product delivery lead times are better
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Enable faster feedback on what we are building</li>
<li>Allow us to course correct more rapidly</li>
<li>Deliver a fix rapidly and with high confidence</li>
</ol></li>
<li>We measure product delivery lead time as /the time it takes
to go from code committed to code successfully running in
production/</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deployment frequency
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reducing batch size is another central element of the Lean
paradigm
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Reduced cycle times and variability in flow</li>
<li>Accelerates feedback</li>
<li>Reduces risk and overhead</li>
<li>Improves efficiency</li>
<li>Increases motivation and urgency</li>
<li>Reduces costs and schedule growth</li>
</ol></li>
<li>However, in software, batch size is hard to measure and
communicate across contexts as there is no visible inventory.</li>
<li>Therefore, we settled on deployment frequency as a proxy for
batch size since it is easy to measure and typically has low
variability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time to restore service
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In modern software products and services, which are rapidly
changing complex systems, failure is inevitable</li>
<li>So the key question becomes: How quickly can service be
restored?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Change fail rate
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the context of Lean, this is the same as percent complete
and accurate for the product delivery process</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cluster Analysis</li>
<li>The survey results demonstrate that <b>there is no trade off between
improving performance and achieving higher levels of quality</b> and
stability</li>
<li>Does software delivery performance matter?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>THE IMPACT OF DELIVERY PERFORMANCE ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your organization's software delivery capability can in fact
provide a competitive advantage to your business</li>
<li>Software delivery performance impacts organizational performance
and noncommercial performance</li>
<li>In software organizations, the ability to <b>work and deliver in
small batches</b> is especially important
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>because it allows you to gather user feedback quickly (using
techniques such as A/B testing)</li>
<li>the ability to take an experimental approach to product
development is highly correlated with the technical practices
that contribute to continuous delivery.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strategic Software
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't outsource the development of software that is <i>strategic</i> to
tour business</li>
<li>Distinguishing which software is strategic and which isn't, and
managing them appropriately, is of enormous importance.
<ul class="org-ul">

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>DRIVING CHANGE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>it is also possible to model and measure culture quantitatively.</i></li>
<li><p>
Before you are ready to deploy a scientific approach to improving
performance, you must first understand and develop your culture

<li>MODELING AND MEASURING CULTURE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Organizational culture can exist at three levels in organizations
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Basic assumptions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Formed over time as members of a group or organization make
sense of relationships, events, and activities</li>
<li>The least "visible"</li>
<li>The things that we just "know," and may find difficult to
articulate, after we have been long enough in a team</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Values
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More "visible"</li>
<li>collective values and norms</li>
<li>can be discussed and even debated by those who are aware of
them</li>
<li>Provide a lens through which group members view and interpret
the relationships, events, and activities around them</li>
<li>Influence group interactions and activities by establishing
social norms, which shape the actions of group members and
provide contextual rules</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Artifacts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The most "visible"</li>
<li>These artifacts can include
<ol class="org-ol">

<li>Heros and Rituals</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>A typology of organizational cultures
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pathological (power-oriented) organizations are characterized by
large amounts of fear and threat. People often hoard information
or withhold it for political reasons, or distort it to make
themselves look better.</li>
<li>Bureaucratic (rule-oriented) organizations protect
departments. Those in the department want to maintain their
"turf," insist on their own rules, and generally do things by
the book—their book.</li>
<li>Generative (performance-oriented) organizations focus on the
mission. How do we accomplish our goal? Everything is
subordinated to good performance, to doing what we are supposed
to do.</li>

<li>Culture enables information processing through three mechanisms
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>in organizations with a generative culture, people collaborate
more effectively and there is a higher level of trust both
across the organization and up and down the hierarchy</li>
<li>generative culture emphasizes the mission, an emphasis that

also the departmental issues that are so evident in
bureaucratic organizations. The mission is primary.</li>

decision-making.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>not only is better information available for making
decisions,</li>

out to be wrong because the team is more likely to be open

achieving these outcomes.</li>

<li>the research we performed to measure continuous delivery as a
capability and to assess its impact on software delivery
performance, organizational culture, and other outcome measures,

<li>We find that continuous delivery practices do in fact have a
measurable impact on these outcomes.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>WHAT IS CONTINUOUS DELIVERY?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Continuous delivery is a set of capabilities that enable us to get
changes of all kinds into production or into the hands of users
safely, quickly, and sustainably.</li>
<li>Five key principles
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Build quality in.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>build a culture supported by tools and people where we can
detect any issues quickly,</li>
<li>so that they can be fixed straight away when they are cheap
to detect and resolve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Work in small batches.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By splitting work up into much smaller chunks that deliver
measurable business outcomes quickly for a small part of our
target market, we get essential feedback on the work we are
doing so that we can course correct.</li>
<li>Even though working in small chunks adds some overhead, it
reaps enormous rewards by allowing us to avoid work that
delivers zero or negative value for our organizations.</li>
<li>changing the economics of the software delivery process so
the cost of pushing out individual changes is very low.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Computers perform repetitive tasks; people solve problems.</li>
<li>Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement.</li>
<li>Everyone is responsible.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A key objective for management is making the state of these
system-level outcomes transparent, working with the rest of
the organization to set measurable, achievable, time-bound
goals for these outcomes, and then helping their teams work
toward them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Foundations:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Comprehensive configuration management.</li>
<li>Continuous integration (CI).</li>
<li>Continuous testing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No one should be saying they are "done" with any work until
all relevant automated tests have been written and are
passing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Implementing continuous delivery means creating multiple feedback
loops to ensure that high-quality software gets delivered to users
more frequently and more reliably</li>
<li>When implemented correctly, the process of releasing new versions
to users should be a routine activity that can be performed on
demand at any time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>THE IMPACT OF CONTINUOUS DELIVERY
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Drivers of Continuous Delivery
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Version Control</li>
<li>Deployment Automation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Teams can deploy to production (or to end users) on demand,
throughout the software delivery life cycle.</li>

<li>Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Trunk-Based Development</li>
<li>Test Automation</li>
<li>Test Data Management</li>
<li>Shift Left on Security</li>
<li>Loosely Coupled Architecture (<i>5. Architecture</i>)</li>
<li>Empowered Teams
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fast feedback on the quality and deployability of the system
is available to everyone on the team, and people make acting
on this feedback their highest priority.</li>
<li>Teams that can choose their own tools based on what is best
for the users of those tools</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Proactive Notification</li>
</ol></li>
<li><b>If you want to improve your culture, implementing CD practices
will help.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By giving developers the tools to detect problems when they
occur, the time and resources to invest in their development,
and the authority to fix problems straight away, we create an
environment where developers accept responsibility for global
outcomes such as quality and stability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It drives performance improvements in software delivery
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Strong identification with the organization you work for
(<i>10. Employee Satisfaction, Identity, and Engagement</i>)</li>
<li>Higher levels of software delivery performance (lead time,
deploy frequency, time to restore service)</li>
<li>Lower change fail rates</li>
<li>A generative, performance-oriented culture (<i>3. Measuring and
Changing Culture</i>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Investments in technology are also investments in people
(Improvements in CD brought payoffs in the way that work felt)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These investments will make our technology process more
sustainable
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Less Rework</li>
<li>Lower levels of deployment pain</li>
<li>Reduced team burnout (<i>9. Making Work Sustainable</i>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace
indefinitely (<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>THE IMPACT OF CONTINUOUS DELIVERY ON QUALITY
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We first have to find some way to measure quality
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
This is challenging because quality is very contextual and
subjective
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quality is value to some person. - <a href="https://leanpub.com/b/qualitysoftware">Quality Software (Management)</a>
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Several proxy variables for quality
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Change fail rates</li>
<li>The quality and performance of applications, as perceived by
those working on them</li>
<li><b>The percentage of time spent on rework or unplanned work</b>
(The strongest correlation)</li>
<li>The percentage of time spent working on defects identified by
end users</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Continuous delivery predicts lower levels of unplanned work and
rework in a statistically significant way

<li>Unplanned work and rework are useful proxies for quality because
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They represent a failure to build quality into our products</li>

the difference between
<dl class="org-dl">

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Failure demand is demand for work caused by the failure to

</ul></li>
<li>CONTINUOUS DELIVERY PRACTICES: WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Architecture and tool choice (<i>5. Architecture</i>)</li>
<li>Version Control
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keep as much things in version control as possible
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Application code</li>
<li>System configuration</li>
<li>Application configuration</li>
<li>Scripts for automating build and configuration in version
control</li>
</ol></li>
<li>These factors together predict IT performance and form a key
component of CD</li>
<li>Keeping system and application configuration in version control
was more highly correlated with software delivery performance
than keeping application code in version control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Test Automation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the following practices predict IT performance:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Reliable automated tests</li>
<li>Developers primarily create and maintain acceptance tests,
and they can easily reproduce and fix them on their
development workstations
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>having automated tests primarily created and maintained
either by QA or an outsourced party is not correlated with
IT performance.</li>
<li>the theory behind this is that when developers are involved
in creating and maintaining acceptance tests, there are two
important effects.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The code becomes more testable when developers write
tests.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>TDD enforces developers to create more testable
designs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When developers are responsible for the automated tests,
they care more about them and will invest more effort
into maintaining and fixing them</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Testers (still) serve an essential role in the software
delivery lifecycle
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>performing manual testing such as exploratory, usability,
and acceptance testing,</li>
<li>helping to create and evolve suites of automated tests by
working alongside developers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's important to run them (automated tests) regularly
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Developers should get feedback from a more comprehensive
suite of acceptance and performance tests every day.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Furthermore, current builds should be available to testers
for exploratory testing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Test data management
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Successful teams
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>had adequate test data to run their fully automated
test suites</li>
<li>could acquire test data for running automated tests on
demand</li>
<li>test data was not a limit on the automated tests they
could run</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trunk-based development
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Successful teams
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fewer than three active branches at any time</li>
<li>Branches with very short lifetimes (less than a day)</li>
<li>Never had "code freeze" or stabilization periods</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These results are independent of team size, org size, or
industry</li>
<li>Anecdotally, and based on our own experience, we
hypothesize that this is because having multiple long-lived
branches discourages both refactoring and intrateam
communication</li>
<li>GitHub Flow is suitable for open source projects
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>whose contributors are not working on a project full
time.</li>
<li>In that situation, it makes sense for branches that
part-time contributors are working on to live for longer
periods of time without being merged.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Information security
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High-performing teams
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>were more likely to incorporate information security into
the delivery process.</li>
<li>Their infosec personnel provided feedback at every step
of the software delivery lifecycle, from design through
demos to helping with test automation.</li>
<li>However, they did so in a way that did not slow down the
development process, integrating security concerns into
the daily work of teams.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In fact, integrating these security practices contributed
to software delivery performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adopting continuous delivery
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the technical practices of continuous delivery have a huge
impact on many aspects of an organization</li>
<li>Continuous delivery improves both delivery performance and
quality, and also helps improve culture and reduce burnout
and deployment pain</li>
<li>However, <b>implementing these practices often requires
rethinking everything</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how teams work</li>
<li>how they interact with each other</li>
<li>what tools and processes they use</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It also requires substantial investment in test and
deployment automation, combined with relentless work to
simplify systems architecture on an ongoing basis to ensure
that this automation isn't prohibitively expensive to

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf82e845">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High performance is possible with all kinds of systems, provided
that systems—and the teams that build and maintain them—are loosely
coupled.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This key architectural property enables teams to easily test and
deploy individual components or services even as the organization
and the number of systems it operates grow</li>
<li>it allows organizations to <b>increase their productivity as they
scale</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>TYPES OF SYSTEMS AND DELIVERY PERFORMANCE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We discovered that low performers were more likely to say that
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the software they were building—or the set of services they had
to interact with—was custom software developed by another
company (e.g., an outsourcing partner).</li>
<li>to be working on mainframe systems.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In the rest of the cases, there was no significant correlation
between system type and delivery performance.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This reinforces the importance of <b>focusing on the architectural
characteristics</b>, discussed below, rather than the
implementation details of your architecture.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's possible to achieve these characteristics even with
packaged software and "legacy" mainframe systems</li>
<li>employing the latest whizzy microservices architecture
deployed on containers is no guarantee of higher performance
if you ignore these characteristics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>it's important to invest in your capabilities to create and
evolve the core, strategic software products and services that
provide a key differentiator for your business.</li>
<li>The fact that low performers were more likely to be using—or
integrating against—custom software developed by another company
underlines the importance of bringing this capability in-house.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>FOCUS ON DEPLOYABILITY AND TESTABILITY
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Those who agreed with the following statements were more likely to
be in the high-performing group:
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>testability</dt><dd>We can do most of our testing without requiring
an integrated environment.</dd>
<dt>deployability</dt><dd>We can and do deploy or release our application
independently of other applications/services it
depends on.</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>To achieve these characteristics, design systems are loosely
coupled—that is, can be changed and validated independently of
each other.</li>
<li>The biggest contributor to continuous delivery in the 2017
analysis—larger even than test and deployment automation—is
whether teams can:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make large-scale changes to the design of their system without
the permission of somebody outside the team</li>
<li>Make large-scale changes to the design of their system without
depending on other teams to make changes in their systems or
creating significant work for other teams</li>
<li>Complete their work without communicating and coordinating with
people outside their team</li>
<li>Deploy and release their product or service on demand,
regardless of other services it depends upon</li>
<li>Do most of their testing on demand, without requiring an
integrated test environment</li>
<li>Perform deployments during normal business hours with
negligible downtime</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To enable this, we must also ensure delivery teams are
cross-functional, with all the skills necessary to design,
develop, test, deploy, and operate the system on the same team.</li>
<li>Our research lends support to what is sometimes called the
"inverse Conway Maneuver"
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="///Users/dsdshcym/Dropbox/Calibre Library/Andy Oram/Making Software_ What Really Works, and Why We Believe It (91)/Making Software_ What Really Works, and Wh - Andy Oram.pdf::205">Conway's Corollary</a></li>
<li>Organizations should evolve their team and organizational
structure to achieve the desired architecture.</li>
<li>The goal is for your architecture to support the ability of
teams to get their work done—from design through to
deployment—without requiring high-bandwidth communication
between teams.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Architectural approaches that enable this strategy include
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the use of bounded contexts and APIs as a way to decouple large
domains into smaller, more loosely coupled units</li>
<li>the use of test doubles and virtualization as a way to test
services or components in isolation.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Service-oriented architectures are supposed to enable these
outcomes, as should any true microservices architecture.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, it's essential to be very strict about these outcomes
when implementing such architectures.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, in real life, many so-called service-oriented
architectures don't permit testing and deploying services
independently of each other, and thus will not enable teams to
achieve higher performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The goal of a loosely coupled architecture is to ensure that the
available communication bandwidth isn't overwhelmed by
fine-grained decision-making at the implementation level, so we
can instead use that bandwidth for discussing higher-level shared
goals and how to achieve them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A LOOSELY COUPLED ARCHITECTURE ENABLES SCALING
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we achieve a loosely coupled, well-encapsulated architecture
with an organizational structure to match, two important things
happen.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>we can achieve better delivery performance, increasing both
tempo and stability while reducing the burnout and the pain of
deployment.</li>
<li>we can substantially grow the size of our engineering
organization and increase productivity linearly—or better than
linearly—as we do so.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To measure productivity, we calculated the following metric from
our data: number of deploys per day per developer.</li>
<li>As the number of developers increases, we found: Low performers
deploy with decreasing frequency. Medium performers deploy at a
constant frequency. High performers deploy at a significantly
increasing frequency.</li>
<li>This allows our business to move faster as we add more people, not
slow down, as is more typically the case.</li>
<li>By focusing on <i>the factors that predict high delivery
performance</i>, we can scale deployments per developer per day
linearly or better with the number of developers.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a goal-oriented generative culture</li>
<li>a modular architecture</li>
<li>engineering practices that enable continuous delivery</li>
<li>effective leadership</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>ALLOW TEAMS TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN TOOLS
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our analysis shows that tool choice is an important piece of
technical work.</li>
<li>When teams can decide which tools they use, it contributes to
software delivery performance and, in turn, to organizational
performance.</li>
<li>The technical professionals who develop and deliver software and
run complex infrastructures make these tool choices based on what
is best for completing their work and supporting their users.</li>
<li>That said, there is a place for standardization, particularly
around the architecture and configuration of infrastructure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ARCHITECTS SHOULD FOCUS ON ENGINEERS AND OUTCOMES, NOT TOOLS OR

win-win solutions in the pursuit of system-level goals</b>, rather

went wrong.</li>
<li>However, this kind of behavior is not limited to just development
and operations, it occurs wherever different functions within the

foundational role.</li>
<li>I recognize that my code will be used in ways I cannot anticipate,
in ways it was not designed, and for longer than it was ever
intended.</li>
<li>I recognize that my code will be attacked by talented and
persistent adversaries who threaten our physical, economic, and
national security.</li>
<li>I recognize these things—and I choose to be rugged.</li>
<li>I am rugged because I refuse to be a source of vulnerability or
weakness.</li>
<li>I am rugged because I assure my code will support its mission.</li>
<li>I am rugged because my code can face these challenges and persist
in spite of them.</li>
<li>I am rugged, not because it is easy, but because it is necessary

and productivity metrics and the current status of work
(including defects),</li>
<li>making these visual displays available to both engineers and
leaders,</li>
<li>aligning these metrics with operational goals</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Feedback from Production</li>
<li>Lightweight Change Approvals</li>
</ul></li>
<li>WIP limits on their own do not strongly predict delivery
performance.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's only when they're combined with the use of visual displays
and have a feedback loop from production monitoring tools back
to delivery teams or the business that we see a strong effect.</li>
<li>When teams use these tools together, we see a much stronger
positive effect on software delivery performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>what exactly we're measuring.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>WIP limits are no good if they don't lead to improvements that
increase flow.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>whether they are good at limiting their WIP and have processes
in place to do so.</li>
<li>if their WIP limits make obstacles to higher flow visible,</li>
<li>if teams remove these obstacles through process improvement,
leading to improved throughput.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visibility, and the high-quality communication it (visual
displays) enables, are key.  (the types of information being
displayed, how broadly it is being shared, and how easy it is to
access.)

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>IMPLEMENT A LIGHTWEIGHT CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>approval only for high-risk changes was not correlated with
software delivery performance.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Teams that reported no approval process or used peer review
achieved higher software delivery performance.</li>
<li>Teams that required approval by an external body achieved lower
performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In short, approval by an external body (such as a manager or
CAB) simply doesn't work to increase the stability of production
systems, measured by the time to restore service and change fail
rate.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>External approvals were negatively correlated with lead time,
deployment frequency, and restore time,</li>
<li>and had no correlation with change fail rate.</li>
<li>It certainly slows things down.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use a <b>lightweight change approval process based on peer review</b>,
such as
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>pair programming or intrateam code review,</li>
<li>combined with a deployment pipeline to detect and reject bad
changes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This process can be used for all kinds of changes, including code,
infrastructure, and database changes.</li>
<li>Logically, it's clear <b>why approval by external bodies is
problematic.</b>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>After all, software systems are complex.</li>
<li>Every developer has made a seemingly innocuous change that took
down part of the system.</li>
<li>What are the chances that an external body, not intimately
familiar with the internals of a system, can review tens of
thousands of lines of code change by potentially hundreds of
engineers and accurately determine the impact on a complex
production system?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>At best, this process only introduces time delays and handoffs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This idea is a form of risk management theater:</li>
<li><b>we check boxes so that when something goes wrong, we can say
that at least we followed the process.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>There's a place for people outside teams to do effective risk
management around changes.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, this is more of a governance role than actually
inspecting changes.</li>
<li><b>Such teams should be monitoring delivery performance and
helping teams improve it</b> by implementing practices that are
known to increase stability, quality, and speed, such as the
continuous delivery and Lean management practices described in

<li>The Lean Startup</li>
<li>LEAN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Components of Lean Product Management
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Work in Small Batches
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The key to working in small batches is to have work decomposed
into features that allow for rapid development,</li>
<li>instead of complex features developed on branches and released
infrequently.</li>
<li>This idea can be applied at both the feature and the product
level.</li>
<li>An MVP is a prototype of a product with just enough features
to enable validated learning about the product and its
business model.</li>
<li>Working in small batches enables short lead times and faster
feedback loops.</li>
<li>it allows you to gather user feedback quickly using techniques
such as A/B testing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make Flow of Work Visible</li>
<li>Gather &amp; Implement Customer Feedback
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>regularly collecting customer satisfaction metrics,</li>
<li>actively seeking customer insights on the quality of products
and features,</li>
<li>using this feedback to inform the design of products and
features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Team Experimentation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many development teams working in organizations that claim to
be Agile are nonetheless obliged to follow requirements
created by different teams.</li>
<li>One of the points of Agile development is to seek input from
customers throughout the development process, including early
stages.</li>
<li>This allows the development team to gather important
information, which then informs the next stages of development</li>
<li>But if a development team isn't allowed, without authorization
from some outside body, to change requirements or
specifications in response to what they discover, their
ability to innovate is sharply inhibited</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To be effective, Experimentation should be combined with the
other capabilities we measure here (above)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ensures that your teams are making well-reasoned, informed
choices about the design, development, and delivery of work,
and changing it based on feedback</li>
<li>ensures that informed decisions they make are communicated
throughout the organization</li>
<li>increases the probability that the ideas and features they
build will deliver delight to customers and add value to the

<li>DEPLOYMENT PAIN
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Deployment pain: The fear and anxiety that engineers and technical
staff fell when they push code into production</li>
<li>It can tell us a lot about a team's software delivery performance</li>
<li>It highlights the friction and disconnect that exist between
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Development</dt><dd>the activities used to develop and test software</dd>
<dt>IT operations</dt><dd>the work done to maintain and keep software
operational</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>It is where there is the greatest potential for differences
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>in environment</li>
<li>in process and methodology</li>
<li>in mindset</li>
<li>even in the words teams use to describe the work they do</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Deployment pain can be
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>an indication that software development and delivery is not
sustainable in your organization
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Where code deployments are most painful, you'll find the
poorest software delivery performance, organizational
performance, and culture</li>
<li>A high correlation between deployment pain and key outcomes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a concern when development and test teams have no idea what
deployments are like
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If your teams have no visibility into code deployments,
that's another warning that software delivery performance
could be low</li>
<li>because if developers or tests aren't aware of the deployment
process, there are probably barriers hiding the work from
them</li>
<li>And barriers that hide the work of deployment from developers
are rarely good, because they isolate developers from the
downstream consequences of their work</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>A measure to capture how people feel when code is deployed:
<b>if deployments were feared, disruptive in their work, or, in
contrast, if they were easy and pain-free</b></li>
<li>Improving key technical capabilities reduces deployment pain
(<i>4. Technical Practices</i>, <i>5. Architecture</i>)</li>
<li>How Painful Are Your Deployments?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ask your team
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>How painful deployments are</li>
<li>What specific things are causing that pain</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Be aware that if deployments have to be performed outside of
normal business hours, that's a sign of architectural problems
that should be addressed.</li>
<li>It's entirely possible—given sufficient investment—to build
complex, large-scale distributed systems which allow for fully
automated deployments with zero downtime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fundamentally, most deployment problems are caused by a complex,
brittle deployment process.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Software is often not written with deployability in mind
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A common symptom here is when complex, orchestrated
deployments are required because the software expects its
environment and dependencies to be set up in a very
particular way and does not tolerate any kind of deviation
from these expectations, giving little useful information to
administrators on what is wrong and why it is failing to
operate correctly.</li>
<li>These characteristics also represent poor design for
distributed systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The probability of a failed deployment rises substantially when
manual changes must be made to production environments as part
of the deployment process.</li>
<li>complex deployments often require multiple handoffs between
teams, particularly in siloed organizations where database
administrators, network administrators, systems administrators,
infosec, testing/QA, and developers all work in separate teams.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In order to reduce deployment pain, we should:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Build systems that are designed to be deployed easily into
multiple environments, can detect and tolerate failures in
their environments, and can have various components of the
system updated independently</li>
<li>Ensure that the state of production systems can be reproduced
(with the exception of production data) in an automated fashion
from information in version control</li>
<li>Build intelligence into the application and the platform so
that the deployment process can be as simple as possible</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Deployment pain can lead to burnout if left unchecked</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BURNOUT
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Burnout is physical, mental, or emotional exhaustion caused by
overwork or stress—but it is more than just being overworked or
stressed.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Burnout can make the things we once loved about our work and
life seem insignificant and dull.</li>
<li>It often manifests itself as a feeling of helplessness, and is
correlated with pathological cultures and unproductive, wasteful
work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Research shows that stressful jobs can be as bad for physical
health as secondhand smoke and obesity</li>
<li>Symptoms of burnout include:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>feeling exhausted, cynical, or ineffective</li>
<li>little or no sense of accomplishment in your work</li>
<li>feelings about your work negatively affecting other aspects of
your life</li>
<li>(In extreme cases)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>family issues</li>
<li>severe clinical depression</li>
<li>suicide</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Job stress also affects employers
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>costing the US economy $300 billion per year in sick time,
long-term disability, and excessive job turnover</li>
<li>Thus, employers have both a duty of care toward employees and a
fiduciary obligation to ensure staff do not become burned out.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Burnout can be prevented or reversed, and DevOps can help
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>foster a supportive work environment</li>
<li>ensure work is meaningful</li>
<li>ensure employees understand how their own work ties to
strategic objectives</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Technology managers often try to fix the person while ignoring the
work environment
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>even though changing the environment is far more vital for
long-term success</li>
<li>Managers who want to avert employee burnout should concentrate
their attention and efforts on
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Fostering a respectful, supportive work environment that
emphasizes learning from failures rather than blaming</li>
<li>Communicating a strong sense of purpose</li>
<li>Investing in employee development</li>
<li>Asking employees what is preventing them from achieving their
objectives and then fixing those things</li>
<li>Giving employees time, space, and resources to experiment and
learn</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Employees must be given the authority to make decisions that
affect their work and their jobs, particularly in areas where
they are responsible for the outcomes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>COMMON PROBLEMS THAT CAN LEAD TO BURNOUT
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Six organizational risk factors that predict burnout
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>work overload: job demands exceed human limits</li>
<li>Lack of control: inability to influence decisions that affect

social rewards</li>
<li>Breakdown of community: unsupportive workplace environment</li>
<li>Absence of fairness: lack of fairness in decision-making
processes</li>
<li>Value conflicts: mismatch in organizational values and the

</ol></li>
<li><i>11. Leaders and Managers</i></li>
<li>To measure burnout, we asked respondents:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If they felt burned out or exhausted</li>
<li>If they felt indifferent or cynical about their work, or if they
felt ineffective</li>
<li>If their work was having a negative effect on their life</li>

</ol></li>
<li>A point worth mentioning is <b>the importance of values alignment</b>
and its role in fighting burnout.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When organizational values and individual values aren't aligned,
you are more likely to see burnout in employees, particularly in
demanding and high-risk work like technology.</li>
<li><b>When organizational values and individual values are aligned,
the effects of burnout can be lessened and even counteracted.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is important to note that the organizational values we mention
here are <b>the real, actual, lived organizational values felt by
employees.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If there is a values mismatch, burnout will be a concern.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>between an employee and their organization,</li>
<li>between the organization's stated values and their actual

When leaders invest in their people and enable them to do their best
work, employees identify more strongly with the organization and are
willing to go the extra mile to help it be successful. In return,
organizations get higher levels of performance and productivity,
which lead to better outcomes for the business.

<pre class="example">
Continuous Delivery / Lean Practices -&gt; Identity -&gt; Organizational Performance
</pre></li>
<li>Effective management practices combined with technical approaches,
such as continuous delivery, don't just impact performance, they
also have a measurable effect on organizational culture.</li>
<li>To measure the extent to which survey respondents identify with the
organizations they work for
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I am glad I chose to work for this organization rather than
another company.</li>
<li>I talk of this organization to my friends as a great company to
work for.</li>
<li>I am willing to put in a great deal of effort beyond what is
normally expected to help my organization be successful.</li>
<li>I find that my values and my organization's values are very

experimental approach to product development will build better
products, and will also feel more connected to the rest of their

identity, may very well help reduce burnout.</li>
<li>This creates a virtuous circle of value creation in the
business where investments in technology and process that make
the work better for our people are essential for delivering
value for our customers and the business.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>This is in contrast to the way many companies still work:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>requirements are handed down to development teams who must then
deliver large stacks of work in batches.</li>
<li>In this model, employees feel little control over the products
they build and the customer outcomes they create, and little
connection to the organizations they work for.</li>
<li>This is immensely demotivating for teams and leads to employees
feeling emotionally disconnected from their work— and to worse
organizational outcomes.</li>

<li>In today's fast-moving and competitive world, the best thing you can
do for your products, your company, and your people is <b>institute a
culture of experimentation and learning</b>, and <b>invest in the

Continuous Delivery / Lean Practices -&gt; Job Satisfaction -&gt; Organizational Performance
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This cycle of continuous improvement and learning is what sets
successful companies apart, enabling them to innovate, get ahead
of the competition—and win.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>HOW DOES DEVOPS CONTRIBUTE TO JOB SATISFACTION?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Job satisfaction depends strongly on having the right tools and
resources to do your work</li>
<li>In fact, our measure of job satisfaction looks at a few key
things:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>if you are satisfied in your work,</li>
<li>if you are given the tools and resources to do your work,</li>
<li>if your job makes good use of your skills and abilities.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Tools are an important component of DevOps practices, and many of
these tools <b>enable automation</b>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Automation matters because it gives over to computers the things
computers are good at—rote tasks that require no thinking and
that in fact are done better when you don't think too much about
them.</li>
<li>Since humans are so bad at these kinds of tasks, turning them
over to computers allows people to focus on the things they're
good at: weighing the evidence, thinking through problems, and
making decisions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Being able to apply one's judgment and experience to challenging
problems is a big part of what makes people satisfied with their
work.</li>
<li>Practices like proactive monitoring and test and deployment
automation all
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>automate menial tasks</b> and <b>require people to make decisions
based on a feedback loop</b></li>
<li>Instead of managing tasks, people get to make decisions,

technology transformations</li>

<h4 id="org6d8dd21">TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6d8dd21">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>by 2020, half of the CIOs who have not transformed their teams'
capabilities will be displaced from their organizations' digital
leadership teams</li>
<li>leadership really does have a powerful impact on results.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>leadership is about inspiring and motivating those around you.</li>
<li>A good leader affects a team's ability to deliver code, architect
good systems, and apply Lean principles to how the team manages
its work and develops products.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In our opinion, the role of leadership on technology transformation
has been one of the more overlooked topics in DevOps,</li>
<li>Transformational leadership is essential for:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Establishing and supporting generative and high-trust cultural
norms</li>
<li>Creating technologies that enable developer productivity,
reducing code deployment lead times and supporting more reliable
infrastructures</li>
<li>Supporting team experimentation and innovation, and creating and
implementing better products faster</li>
<li>Working across organizational silos to achieve strategic
alignment</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To capture transformational leadership, we used a model that
includes five dimensions (Rafferty and Griffin 2004).
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Vision</dt><dd>Has a clear understanding of where the organization is
going and where it should be in five years.</dd>
<dt>Inspirational communication</dt><dd>Communicates in a way that inspires and motivates, even in an
uncertain or changing environment.</dd>
<dt>Intellectual stimulation</dt><dd>Challenges followers to think about problems in new ways.</dd>
<dt>Supportive leadership</dt><dd>Demonstrates care and consideration of followers' personal
needs and feelings.</dd>
<dt>Personal recognition</dt><dd>Praises and acknowledges achievement of goals and improvements
in work quality; personally compliments others when they do
outstanding work.</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>What Is Transformational Leadership?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Transformational leadership means leaders inspiring and motivating
followers to achieve higher performance by appealing to their
values and sense of purpose, facilitating wide-scale
organizational change.</li>
<li>Such leaders encourage their teams to work toward a common goal
through their vision, values, communication, example-setting, and
their evident caring about their followers' personal needs.</li>
<li>there are similarities between servant leadership and
transformational leadership, but they differ in the leader's
focus.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Servant leaders focus on their followers' development and
performance,</li>
<li>transformational leaders focus on getting followers to identify
with the organization and engage in support of organizational
objectives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>it (transformational leadership) is more predictive of performance
outcomes in other contexts,</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We observed significant differences in leadership characteristics
among high-, medium-, and low-performing teams.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High-performing teams reported having leaders with the strongest
behaviors across all dimensions</li>
<li>low-performing teams reported the lowest levels of these
leadership characteristics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Teams with the least transformative leaders are far less likely to
be high performers.</li>
<li>Transformational leadership is highly correlated with employee Net
Promoter Score.</li>
<li>A transformational leader's influence is seen through their support
of their teams' work, be that in technical practices or product
management capabilities.</li>
<li>Leaders alone cannot achieve high DevOps outcomes.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Leaders cannot achieve goals on their own.</li>
<li>They need their teams executing the work on a suitable
architecture, with good technical practices, use of Lean
principles, and all the other factors that we've studied over the
years.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In summary
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>leadership helps build great teams, great technology, and great
organizations</li>
<li>indirectly, leadership enables teams to rearchitect their systems
and implement the necessary continuous delivery and Lean
management practices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transformational leadership
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>enables the practices that correlate with high performance</li>
<li>supports effective communication and collaboration between team
members in pursuit of organizational goals.</li>
<li>provides the foundation for a culture in which continuous
experimentation and learning is part of everybody's daily work.</li>

<li>it just amplifies the effectiveness of the technical and
organizational practices we have been studying over several years.</li>

<h4 id="org9eb34a7">THE ROLE OF MANAGERS</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9eb34a7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Managers are those who have responsibility for people, and often
budgets and resources, in organizations.</li>
<li>Managers, in particular, play a critical role in connecting the
strategic objectives of the business to the work their teams do.</li>
<li>Managers can do a lot to improve their team's performance by
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>creating a work environment where employees feel safe,</li>
<li>investing in developing the capabilities of their people</li>
<li>removing obstacles to work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When it comes to culture, managers can improve matters by
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>enabling specific DevOps practices in their teams</li>
<li>visibly investing in DevOps and in their employees' professional
development.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Managers can also facilitate big improvements in software delivery
performance by taking measures to make deployments less painful.</li>
<li>managers should make performance metrics visible and take pains to
align these with organizational goals, and should delegate more
authority to their employees.</li>
<li><b>Knowledge is power, and you should give power to those who have the
knowledge.</b></li>
<li>What could investment in DevOps initiatives and my teams look like?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ensure that existing resources are made available and accessible
to everyone in the organization. Create space and opportunities
for learning and improving.</li>
<li>Establish a dedicated training budget and make sure people know
about it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Also, give your staff the latitude to choose training that
interests them.</li>
<li>This training budget may include dedicated time during the day
to make use of resources that already exist in the organization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Encourage staff to attend technical conferences at least once a
year and summarize what they learned for the entire team.</li>
<li>Set up internal hack days, where cross-functional teams can get
together to work on a project.</li>
<li>Encourage teams to organize internal “yak days,” where teams get
together to work on technical debt.</li>
<li>Hold regular internal DevOps mini-conferences.</li>
<li>Give staff dedicated time, such as 20% time or several days after
a release, to experiment with new tools and technologies. Allocate
budget and infrastructure for special projects.</li>

<h4 id="org206a954">TIPS TO IMPROVE CULTURE AND SUPPORT YOUR TEAMS</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org206a954">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>perhaps the most valuable work they can do is <b>growing and
supporting a strong organizational culture</b> among those they serve:
their teams.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This allows the experts that work with and for them to operate at
maximum effectiveness, creating value for the organization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>three things are highly correlated with software delivery
performance and contribute to a strong team culture:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Enable cross-functional collaboration
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Building trust with your counterparts on other teams.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trust is built on kept promises, open communication, and
behaving predictably even in stressful situations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Encouraging practitioners to move between departments.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This sort of lateral move can be incredibly valuable to both
teams.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Practitioners bring valuable information about processes and
challenges to their new team</li>
<li>Members of the previous team have a natural point person
when reaching out to collaborate.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actively seeking, encouraging, and rewarding work that
facilitates collaboration
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make sure success is reproducible and pay attention to latent
factors that make collaboration easier.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use Disaster Recovery Testing (DiRT) Exercises to Build
Relationships
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in which outages are simulated or actually created according
to a pre-prepared plan, and teams must work together to
maintain or restore service levels.</li>
<li>For DiRT-style events to be successful, an organization first
needs to accept system and process failures as a means of
learning</li>
<li>We design tests that require engineers from several groups who
might not normally work together to interact with each other</li>
<li>That way, should a real large-scale disaster ever strike,
these people will already have strong working relationships</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Help create a climate of learning
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Creating a training budget and advocating for it internally
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Emphasize how much the organization values a climate of
learning by putting resources behind formal education
opportunities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensuring that your team has the resources to engage in informal
learning and the space to explore ideas.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learning often happens outside of formal education</li>
<li>20% time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Making it safe to fail.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If failure is punished, people won't try new things.</li>
<li>Treating failures as opportunities to learn</li>
<li>Holding blameless postmortems to work out how to improve
processes and systems
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>helps people feel comfortable taking (reasonable) risks</li>
<li>helps create a culture of innovation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Creating opportunities and spaces to share information
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Set up a regular cadence of opportunities for employees to
share their knowledge
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>weekly lightning talks</li>
<li>offer resources for monthly lunch-and-learns</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Encourage sharing and innovation by having demo days and forums</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make effective use of tools
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make sure your team can choose their tools</li>
<li>Make monitoring a priority
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The visibility and transparency yielded by effective
monitoring are invaluable.</li>
<li>Proactive monitoring was strongly related to performance and
job satisfaction in our survey, and it is a key part of a
strong technical foundation</li>

<li><i>11. Leaders and Managers</i></li>
<li>Why have technology practitioners continuously sought to improve the
approach to software development and deployment as well as the
stability and security of infrastructure and platforms, yet, in
large part, have overlooked (or are unclear about) the way to lead,
manage, and sustain these endeavors?</li>
<li>Why we must improve the way we lead and manage IT and, indeed,
re-imagine the way everyone across the enterprise views and engages
with technology.</li>
<li>We are in the midst of a complete transformation in the way value is
created, delivered, and consumed.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our ability to rapidly and effectively envision, develop, and
deliver technology-related value to enhance the customer

from each other?</li>
<li>And as we learn, how do we share that learning across the

is a form of <i>strategy deployment</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lean practitioners use the term Hoshin Kanri.</li>

<li><b>the organization that leads is the one with the people with
consistent behavior to rapidly learn and adapt.</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Too often, quality is overshadowed by the pressure for speed. A
courageous and supportive leader is crucial to help teams "<b>slow
down to speed up</b>,"
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>providing them with the permission and safety to put quality
first (fit for use and purpose)</li>
<li>which, in the long run, improves speed, consistency, and
capacity while reducing cost, delays, and rework. Best of all,
this improves customer satisfaction and trust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>focusing on "going deep before going wide."</li>
<li>Another challenge the coaches are experimenting with is dispersed
teams.</li>
<li>As a leader, you have to look at your own behaviors before you ask
others to change</li>
<li>You get impatient wanting to speed their learning but then you
realize you went through this yourself, and it took
time. <b>Storytelling is important, but they have to have their own
learning</b></li>
<li>Over the years, they have experimented with different
problem-solving methods, including A3, Kata, Lean startup, and
others, and finally settled on a blend of elements that they found
helpful, creating their own approach
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Their approach is to gather the right people who have experience
and insights into the problem to rigorously examine the current
condition.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This rigor pays off, as the team gains insights that increase
the probability of identifying the root cause rather than just
the symptoms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With this learning, they form a hypothesis about an approach to
improvement, including how and what to measure to learn if the
experiment produces the desired outcomes.</li>
<li>If the experiment is a success, they make it part of the
standard work, share the learning, and continue to monitor to
ensure the improvement is sustained</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Why it works:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>because it helps people to embrace change, letting people come
up with their own ideas, which they can then test out</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Amidst this colorful, creative work environment, with a philosophy
of “make it your own,” the idea of standard work may seem to be
antithetical, even counterproductive.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>when teams have a standard way of work, following that standard
saves a lot of time and energy.</li>
<li>standard work is established not by imitating a way of work that
is prescribed in a book or used successfully by another company</li>
<li>experiments with different approaches and agrees upon the one best
way to do the work.</li>
<li>As conditions change, the standard is reevaluated and improved.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We had to learn ourselves to become a learning team.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we were not able to learn as management, we were not able to
help the teams to learn.</li>
<li>We [his management team] experienced our own learning, then we
went to the teams to help them learn to become a learning team</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you change the way you work, you change the routines, you
create a different culture</li>
<li>We give them speed with quality.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes, we may take a little longer than some of the others to
reach green,</li>
<li>but once we achieve it, we tend to stay green, when a lot of the
others go back to red</li>

<h4 id="org816233d">TRANSFORMING YOUR LEADERSHIP, MANAGEMENT, AND TEAM PRACTICES</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org816233d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We believe the better questions (than "How do we change our
culture") to ask are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How do we learn how to learn?</li>
<li>How do I learn?</li>
<li>How can I make it safe for others to learn?</li>
<li>How can I learn from and with them?</li>
<li>How do we, together, establish new behaviors and new ways of
thinking that build new habits, that cultivate our new culture?</li>
<li>Where do we start?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Let's try this together. Even if it doesn't work, we will learn
something that will help us to be better. Will you join me in this
and see what we can learn?”</li>
<li><b>There is no checklist or playbook.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can't "implement” culture change.</li>
<li>Implementation thinking (attempting to mimic another company's
specific behavior and practices) is, by its very nature, counter
to the essence of generative culture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A high-performance culture is
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>far more than just
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the application of tools,</li>
<li>the adoption of a set of interrelated practices,</li>
<li>copying the behaviors of other successful organizations,</li>
<li>the implementation of a prescribed, expert-designed framework.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>is the <b>development, through experimentation and learning guided
by evidence, of a new way of working together</b> that is
situationally and culturally appropriate to each organization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some suggestions we offer, based on our own experiences in helping
enterprises evolve toward a high-performing, generative culture:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Develop and maintain the right mindset
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is about
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>learning</li>
<li>how to create an environment for shared organizational
learning</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This is not about
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>just doing the practices</li>
<li>employing tools (certainly not)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make it your own
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Don't look to copy other enterprises on their methods and
practices, or to implement an expert-designed model
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Study and learn from them</li>
<li>But then experiment and adapt to what works for you and your
culture</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't contract it out to a large consulting firm to
expediently transform your organization or to implement new
methodologies or practices for you
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your teams will feel that these methodologies (Lean, Agile,
whatever) are being done to them.</li>
<li>While your current processes may temporarily improve, your
teams will not develop the confidence or capability to
sustain, continue to improve, or to adapt and develop new
processes and behaviors on their own.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do develop your own coaches
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Initially you may need to hire outside coaching to establish
a solid foundation, but <b>you must ultimately be the agent of
your own change.</b></li>
<li>Coaching depth is a key lever for sustaining and scaling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>You, too, need to change your way of work.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Whether you are a senior leader, manager, or team member, <b>lead
by example</b></li>
<li><b>A generative culture starts with demonstrating new behaviors,
not delegating them.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice discipline
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Change takes discipline and courage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice patience
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your current way of work took decades to entrench</li>
<li>It's going to take time to change actions and thought patterns
until they become new habits and, eventually, your new culture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice practice
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You just have to try it: <b>learn, succeed, fail, learn, adjust,
repeat.</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>As you learn a new way of leading and working, you, and those you
bring along with you on this journey, will
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>explore, stretch, make some mistakes, get a lot right, learn,
grow, and keep on learning.</li>
<li>discover better and faster ways to engage, learn, and adapt to
changing conditions.</li>
<li>improve quality and speed in everything you do.</li>
<li>grow your own leaders, innovate, and outperform your competition.</li>
<li>more rapidly and effectively improve value for customers and the
enterprise.</li>
<li>"have a measurable impact on an organization's profitability,
productivity, and market share. These also have an impact on
customer satisfaction, efficiency, and the ability to achieve
organizational goals."</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In all of our research, one thing has proved consistently true:
<b>since nearly every company relies on software, delivery performance
is critical to any organization doing business today</b></li>
<li>We hope this book has helped you identify areas where you can
improve your own technology and business processes, work culture,
and improvement cycles</li>
<li>Remember: <b>you can’t buy or copy high performance.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You will need to develop your own capabilities as you pursue a
path that fits your particular context and goals.</li>
<li>This will take sustained effort, investment, focus, and time.</li>
