            <h1>3 Key Ideas Behind The Erlang Thesis</h1>
            <p>
Elixir, my current favorite programming language, is built upon
Erlang. So, to understand many concepts for Elixir, I need to learn
more about Erlang. Without any doubt, the paper written by its
creator, <a href="http://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf">making reliable distributed system in the presence of
software errors</a>, is the best way to learn why Erlang was designed in
this way.
</p>

<p>
This post is my summary of this paper, which are the key points that
make Erlang such a great language.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Concurrency Oriented Programming</li>
<li>Abstracting Concurrency Out</li>
<li>The philosophy of falling back to an easier task when an error occurs</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-org2608660" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2608660">Concurrency Oriented Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2608660">
<p>
Erlang is a Concurrency Oriented Programming Language (COPL). That
means, "the concurrent structure of the program should follow the
concurrent structure of the application." Why this is so important?
</p>

<p>
Because <b>our world is full of concurrency.</b>
</p>

<p>
As it was explained in the paper, "the real world is concurrent."
Every second, there are countless things happening at the same
time. Even we pick one simple thing out, it's still composed of
many concurrent events.
</p>

<p>
The activity of walking is a great example. One's walking is a
cohesive activity to another. But it actually requires many
different muscles to work together, <b>concurrently</b>. And if we dig
deeper, every muscle needs many different cells to work together,
<b>concurrently</b>.
</p>

<p>
Organizations also depend on concurrency to perform well. An
organization is a bunch of different people working together,
<b>concurrently</b>.
</p>

<p>
Another example, which is more important than all the others, is our
computer hardware. Different parts of our computer are working
concurrently. The CPU is getting more and more cores, working
concurrently. With network, multiple computers can become a cluster,
working concurrently.
</p>

<p>
So, we need a concurrency oriented programming language, to model our
hardware and our world. That's why Erlang shines in today's world:
it's built for concurrency.

<h3 id="org2fedf40">Concurrent programming is hard</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2fedf40">
<p>
But writing a concurrent program is hard, way harder than writing a
sequential program.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
We as human beings can hardly think concurrently.
</p>

<p>
For most tasks, we are used to break them down into steps and
compose these small steps back together. And I think that's why
most programming languages are designed for this use case.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to concurrency, a series of sequential steps won't
work. Step 1 may happen after Step 2. Task 4 may finish before
Task 3. And so on.
</p>

<p>
This incompatibility between how we are used to model problems and
how concurrent program works is a main issue that a COP language
needs to solve.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Concurrent programs have more concerns other than solving the
problem itself.
</p>

<p>
Besides the problem modeling, concurrent programs have many other
concerns we need to deal with.
</p>

<p>
For example, when a asynchronous task fails and another task is
waiting for its results, what do we do next? Do we just restart the
failed task and hope this time it will work? Or do we notice the
blocked task and let it fail as well? But then how do we implement
these strategies?
</p>

<p>
These are just a few concerns that we need to consider when
designing concurrent programs. And these concerns are not really
related to the problem we are solving, they are there because they
are the nature of concurrency. So concurrent programs are orders of
magnitude harder than sequential programs.

<div id="outline-container-org8354dd0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8354dd0">Erlang's answer: Abstract out concurrency</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8354dd0">
<p>
So how does Erlang solve this hard problem? The answer from this paper
is actually quite simple: we <i>abstract out the concurrent aspects</i>. By
doing that, we transform a concurrent problem to a sequential problem.
</p>

<p>
The best example for this is the <code>gen_server</code> module/behaviour.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The concurrent issues like storing states, handling failures are all
handled by the Erlang/OTP module <code>gen_server</code>. Modules like
<code>gen_server</code> are maintained by a bunch of professional developers
with tons of experience in concurrent programming. And since
Erlang/OTP is open sourced, these modules can be improved with the
help from the community.</li>
<li>Domain/Business specific problems are solved in application module
callbacks like <code>handle_call</code>, <code>handle_cast</code>, <code>init</code>, etc.. These
callbacks are implemented by us, the developers, users of the
language/framework. Thanks to the hard work behind Erlang/OTP, we
are freed from solving the concurrent problems, and only need to
focus on our specific problems.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org45a7346" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org45a7346">Anything can be abstracted out</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org45a7346">
<p>
If concurrency, an already abstracted concept, can be abstracted
elegantly in Erlang, then I believe anything can be abstracted out as
well.
</p>

<p>
I really like how <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do">Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP</a>
demonstrated the way to design a generic module. Here is an example
of designing the Generic Finite State Machines:
</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>

</p>

<p>
By listing the generic and specific characters of a problem side by
side, we can clearly see how to abstract out the generic part.
</p>

<p>
Using the same approach, the only question left when designing a
abstract module is how you define your problem to split the generic
and the specific. The best way to do that is to write enough specific
code and keep in mind to <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2018/10/26/dont-repeat-your-domain-knowledge/">not repeat your domain language</a>.

<h2 id="org10de586">Fallback, Don't Let It Fail!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org10de586">
<p>
The last but not the least gem from this paper is about how to handle
failures. It's about the philosophy of how Erlang handles
software/hardware failures, or famously known as "Let it crash."
</p>

<p>
"Let it crash" seems to be a controversial idea. People often
misunderstand it as "do nothing when error happens, let it crash and
the infrastructure will handle it."
</p>

<p>
There's already <a href="https://www.amberbit.com/blog/2019/7/26/the-misunderstanding-of-let-it-crash/">a great explanation about why this is not true from
Hubert Łępicki</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Let it crash" is about <b>building <i>components</i> of software that do not
concern themselves with detailed error handling.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And if we dig further in the original paper, "Let it crash" is really
about <b>task isolation</b> and <b>fallback</b>.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Isolation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Each process should only have one "role", perform one "task".
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Supervisor</dt><dd>watches other processes and restarts them if they
fail.</dd>
<dt>Worker</dt><dd>a normal work process (can have errors).</dd>
<dt>Trusted Worker</dt><dd>not allowed to have errors.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
Fallback:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A strategy for programming fault-tolerance
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>fail immediately if you cannot correct an error</li>
<li>try to do something that is simpler to achieve</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
So "Let it crash" doesn't mean we don't attempt to correct an error
at all. It's just that we fallback to a simpler task when we cannot
correct an error. Often, this simpler task is to restart the failed
task and retry.
</p></li>
</ol>

Hopefully, through this lengthy post, you can get the gist of why
Erlang is a great concurrency-oriented and fault-tolerant language. If
you want to learn more, I would highly recommend you to read <a href="http://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf">the
paper</a>. If you don't have enough time, you can read <a href="https://pragprog.com/articles/erlang">this summary

This idea of abstracting concurrency out is best explained In
the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do">Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP</a>, It used examples
like <code>gen_server</code>, <code>gen_fsm</code>, <code>supervisor</code>, etc. to show how Erlang
and OTP extract these common part of a problem to simplify a
problem. Highly recommended!
