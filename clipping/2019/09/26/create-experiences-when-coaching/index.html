            <h1>Create Experiences When Coaching</h1>
            <p>
<a href="https://yiming.dev/clipping/2019/09/06/clippings-of-2019-aug/#orgd3b7b0e">Since the beginning of my career, I've been nudging people to write
more tests.</a> I learned one thing from these coaching experiences:
<b>coaching is hard.</b> Because coaching requires one to <b>change</b>
another's existing knowledge, and changing another individual is
really hard. So how to coach (a.k.a change people) more effectively?
<b>Creating experience and let people change themselves</b> is the best way
I can tell.

<p>
I can tell the same from my TDD-coaching journey<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Presentation (no experiences) can hardly work
</p>

<p>
When I just started teaching developers about TDD, I thought it was
easy: just gave a presentation with beautiful slides and fancy
gifs, developers would realize TDD as a great tool and become so
excited to learn it by themselves.
</p>

<p>
It turned out that I was too naive. Nothing changed after my first
presentation about testing. Developers still didn't write automated
tests. "Okay, let me try presenting Code Review next time."  Again,
nothing changed. Developers still merged others merge requests
without a glance.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Workshop (a toy) is slightly better
</p>

<p>
Well, I learned the lesson of <a href="https://twitter.com/GeePawHill/status/1151429663413145602">"Try Different, Not Harder"</a> from my
failed presentations. So I began to try different methods.
</p>

<p>
I hosted several workshops around TDD and refactoring. I chose a
small problem beforehand (e.g. <a href="http://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2017/12/08/book-review-99-bottles-of-oop/#orgb711f32">99 Bottles</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/extract-class">thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/extract-class</a>, etc.). Then I organized
developers to work on them in the workshop. After everyone finished
their implementation, we discussed about tradeoffs around different
solutions.
</p>

<p>
Developers enjoyed it. But still, not many tests were added or
refactoring were made in our real projects after the workshop.
</p>

<p>
I wondered why.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
The topic was not focused.
</p>

<p>
During the discussion, We were just exchanging our own opinions.
One developer proposed "don't write your own email regex
expression". Another said "we should plan before coding". So
naturally, people couldn't get the point of testing or
refactoring.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Toy problems were different from real problems.
</p>

<p>
The problems I chose were small enough to be fitted into a short
time frame. The drawback was that they couldn't reflect what to
do in a real project.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to start adding tests in a legacy application with no
existing tests?</li>
<li>How to refactor a complex piece of business logic?</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is the main reason that "toy experiences" work poorly.
</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>
Code review (a small portion of the day-job) move the needle
</p>

<p>
"Toy experiences" didn't work well. Thus I started nudging people
to do code reviews (which was as hard as nudging people to write
tests, if not harder.) Then in the code review session, I left
comments about how to adding tests with examples.
</p>

<p>
Code review moved the needle. Developers saw the benefits of having
some automated tests and another person to check the code before
merging. They started adding tests and assigning merge requests to
me for my suggestions.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Pair programming (the full day-job) is the king
</p>

<p>
Pair programming worked the best. Without mentioning I was trying
to teach TDD or refactoring, I just sit down with a developer to
pair with him. Then we wrote some tests, refactored some code
together. Often, he would see the benefits of testing and
refactoring by himself. And after the pairing session, he would
started writing more tests and refactoring more, without me told
him so.
</p>

<p>
This is the power of creating experiences when coaching.

If you need more proofs, check out this report from Farnam Street:
<a href="https://fs.blog/2013/01/how-people-learn/">Arguments Are For Learning, Not Winning</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More instruction wasnâ€™t helping students advance from novice to
expert.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In fact, the data indicated the opposite:
<b>students had more novice-like beliefs after they completed a
course than they had when they started.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Improved teaching and learning
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A lot of educational and cognitive research can be reduced to this
basic principle: <b>People learn by creating their own understanding.</b></li>
<li>Effective teaching facilitates that creation by getting students
engaged in thinking deeply about the subject at an appropriate
level and then monitoring that thinking and guiding it to be more
expert-like.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reducing Cognitive Load</li>
<li>Addressing Beliefs</li>
<li>Stimulating and Guiding Thinking</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that <b>people learn by creating their own understanding.</b> How can
a person create her own understanding? From her own experiences!
</p>

<p>
So, please remember this when coaching others, <b>bring less
instructions, create more experiences!</b>
