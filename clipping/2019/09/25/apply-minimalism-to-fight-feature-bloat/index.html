<p>
A few days ago, I read <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/feature-bloat-the-product-manager-s-dilemma">this HBS report about the "Feature Bloat"
dilemma in product management</a>.
</p>

<p>
The problem described in this report resonates with me.
</p>

<p>
On the development side, a feature-bloated product comes with a
codebase that's also bloated, complex, and poorly tested.
</p>

<p>
On the project management side, a feature-bloated product has so many
features that adding a new feature or changing an old behavior may
break other features. Thus fewer features get added, fewer changes are
made, and the project stales.
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Developer: *unpublishes 11 lines of JavaScript*<br><br>JavaScript:<br><br> <a href="https://t.co/b5lX0fJxha">pic.twitter.com/b5lX0fJxha</a></p>&mdash; swyx (@swyx) <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1173260769041035264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>
A feature-bloated product is like the tower in this tweet: changing a
small piece of code, and the whole tower is down.
(P.S. JavaScript ecosystem is a great example as a feature bloated
product.)
</p>

<p>
But why does "Feature Bloat" exist? And why is it a dilemma?
</p>

<p>
Turns out the reason is simple:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Because consumers perceive value in this Swiss-Army-Knife approach
and will pay for the added utility.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Due to this conflict between consumers' needs for more features and
our needs for maintaining the product, "Feature Bloat" becomes a
dilemma.
</p>

<p>
How to break out of this dilemma? The report proposes some solutions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Remove features</li>
<li>Build simpler products</li>
<li>Give consumers decision aids</li>
<li>Design products that do one thing very well</li>
<li>Use prototypes and product-​in-​use research</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
So far so good, but I'm surprised by a fact, that this report was
written in <b>2006</b>! As you may know, I started my career
around 2016. So a decade has passed, nothing has changed?!

<h2 id="orgd95c3dc">The End of iTunes: Do One Thing And Do It Well</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd95c3dc">
<p>
Let's take iTunes for example.
</p>

<p>
iTunes is probably the most famous feature-bloated product in the last
10+ years.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It plays music, movies, podcasts, audio books.</li>
<li>It manages your local music library and your Apple Music
subscription.</li>
<li>Plus, it also is the tool you use to manage your iPhone/iPod/iPad
from your Mac.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's been years that Mac users complaining about this huge giant.
Finally in the upcomming macOS this year, iTunes splits into three
apps,: Apple Music, Podcasts, and TV. And iOS devices management is
moved into Finder.
</p>

<p>
From the story of iTunes, we can see that we are still struggling with
the "Feature Bloat" dilemma. And by design three products that do one
thing well, Apple find a way out.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3c28bc0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3c28bc0">Heroku: Apply Minimalism to Product</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3c28bc0">
<p>
But breaking iTunes down works because all the features are still
there, just not in the same app. What if we can't split our product
and we still need to add more features?
</p>

<p>
Heroku finds a way: <a href="https://brandur.org/minimalism">pursuing production minimalism</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Through ephemeralization from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nine-Chains-Moon-Buckminster-Fuller/dp/0385011490">Nine Chains to the Moon</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>"Do more and more with less and less until eventually you can do
everything with nothing."</b></li>
<li>building a stack that scales to more users and more activity while
the people and infrastructure supporting it stay fixed.</li>
<li>This is accomplished by building systems that are more robust,
more automatic, and less prone to problems because the tendency to
grow in complexity that’s inherent to them has been understood,
harnessed, and reversed.</li>
<li>Realistic? Probably not. Useful? Yes. Even falling short of an
incredibly ambitious goal tends to leave you somewhere good.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea of "do more with less" sticks with me. In the same post,
Brandur Leach gave several examples from Heroku's practice. Please do
check them out!

<div id="outline-container-org2fe6eae" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2fe6eae">Emacs &amp; Vim: Text Editor Minimalism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2fe6eae">
<p>
To give product minimalism a close look, you definitely need to know
Emacs and Vim.
</p>

<p>
Emacs and Vim are two of the most powerful text editors in this
world. They are powerful because they can do anything you can imagine
(or can't imagine) with text editing, and keep the editor core
small.
</p>

<p>
I do these things in Emacs everyday:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Writing code (in various programming languages)</li>
<li>Managing my calendar</li>
<li>Receiving and replying emails</li>
</ul>

<p>
While Emacs is so powerful, it is just a Lisp interpreter at its
core.
</p>

<p>
So how can they achieve this? I think it's the same idea of product
minimalism as Heroku peruses.
</p>

<p>
Their cores are all written in <code>C</code>. And they both have a
package/plugin system, written in <code>Emacs Lisp</code> / <code>Vim script</code>.  Over
the time, they extract features from their <code>C</code> cores as <code>scripts</code>. So
that their cores become smaller, but they can do more by switching
different packages/plugins.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7ff79c3">
<p>
"Feature Bloat" is a serious problem when developing products. To
break out of this dilemma, we have to options depending on the
context:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When features are interdependent from each other, break them into
separated products that do one thing well. (e.g. iTunes)</li>
<li>When features are intertwined with each other, extract additional
features as plugins, and keep the core system small. So that we can
add more features via new plugins, and change existing behavior by
switching plugins.</li>
</ol>
