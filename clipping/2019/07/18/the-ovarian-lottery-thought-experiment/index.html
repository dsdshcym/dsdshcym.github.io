            <p>
I came across this thought experiment on Twitter the other day. I was
quite interested so I put some thoughts into it. I think I have a good
answer now. So I'm going to share this experiment and my answer in
this post with you.

<li>The thought experiment
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's 24 hours before your birth, and a genie appears to you. He
tells you that you can set the rules for the world you're about to
enter — economic, social, political — the whole enchilada. Sounds
great, right? What's the catch?</li>
<li>Before you enter the world, you will pick one ball from a barrel
of 6.8 billion (the number of people on the planet). That ball
will determine your gender, race, nationality, natural abilities,
and health — whether you are born rich or poor, sick or
able-bodied, brilliant or below average, American or Zimbabwean.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We should be designing a society that, as Buffett says, “doesn't
leave behind someone who accidentally got the wrong ball and is not
well-wired for this particular system.”</li>
</ul>

<p>
-- from <a href="https://www.getrichslowly.org/warren-buffett-on-the-lottery-of-birth/">Warren Buffett on the Lottery of Birth</a>
</p>

<p>
In our current world, where and when we are born are really
important. Take myself for example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's not bad for me to be born in one of more-advanced province in
China in the mid of 1990s. So that I was able to go to one of the
best university in Shanghai after several years of hard study. I'm
always grateful for that.</li>
<li><p>
But I'm also jealous of people who were born in U.S. or Europe.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"What if I was able to learn programming way earlier like [some
legendary programmer]?"</li>
<li>"What if I could join [a dream company] in the bay area?"</li>
</ul>

<p>
That being said, I still tell myself, even if I was born in U.S., I
would just face other problems, which may even be harder than
these. So I'm okay with who I am and where I am now.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
So it didn't surprise me that Buffett thought this ball we got from
that lottery was the most important thing in our lives. And that's why
this experiment is interesting to me. How can we change one rule in
this world so that we won't leave anyone behind?
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org46b0005" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org46b0005">Communication Comes to the Rescue</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org46b0005">
<p>
I'm not an economic expert, not to even mention social or
political. I can only come up with this rule to change:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>everyone need to master communication skills during their education.</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It can be a series of mandated courses like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNu0DsyrgsQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">Healthy Relationships
101</a>.</li>
<li>It can be a social rule that enforces everyone to think from each
others' perspective during daily interactions (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/8183220630">How to Win Friends &amp;
Influence People</a>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
As Michael Jascz explained in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNu0DsyrgsQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">talk</a>, we received too few educations
around how to communicate well and maintain healthy relationships with
each other. My parents didn't teach me how to communicate, and they
don't know the best practices as far as I know. My schools didn't have
courses on this topic neither.
</p>

<p>
And I believe this lack of education, or this inability to communicate
well is what prevents everyone in this world to live a better
life. Most of the issues I had in my daily work were caused by
miscommunications. Most of the misunderstandings I had in my daily
life were caused by miscommunications.
</p>

<p>
If this rule becomes true everywhere, everyone can live a better life,
no matter what kind of ball we got. Because this betterment of
communication brings us much more understanding and eases so many pain
points in our lives.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5a9b4e3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5a9b4e3">What Kind of Bad Things Can Happen?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5a9b4e3">
<p>
Then, I took this idea to extreme and thought "Can this rule change go
bad?"
</p>

<p>
Yes, it might.
</p>

<p>
We've already had a perfect example of highly-efficient communication
in our world: Internet.
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>The thought processes are the same</dt><dd>Different machines can have the same infrastructure, the same
CPU, the same instruction set. Then given the same program, they
can "think" in the exactly the same way.</dd>
<dt>The language used for communicating is the same</dt><dd><p>
Even better, the language that used by different machines to talk
over the internet is the same. It's all just 0s or 1s.
</p>

<p>
The higher level of this communicating is also very
efficient. We've defined several common formats for machines to
communicate with each other: JSON, XML, YAML, etc. Different
machines understand a piece of string in the exactly the same
way.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>
But this kind of highly-efficient communication is not what I asked
for humans. To gain this kind of efficiency, machines lose the
creativity along the way. After all, <b>every mistake is a new idea</b>
(<i>from one of my favorite book: <i>Becoming a Technical Leader</i>.</i>)
</p>

<p>
So, what I asked was not "accept others' ideas no matter what", it was
"understand others' ideas from others' point of view first, then use
our best judgment to solve the problem together". This is, what I
believe, a better form of communication.
</p>

<p>
Hope you would agree so and let's build toward a better world by
improving our own communication skills first!
