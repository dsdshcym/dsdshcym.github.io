<p>
"Do we need to migrate to technology X or not?" is an evergreen topic
in software development. And microservices (or service-oriented
architecture, SOA) is a typical hyped example of "technology X".
</p>

<p>
And the answer is as always: "It depends." It depends on your own
context. So unless you've already finished your analysis and come to
the conclusion that microservices can solve the problems you are
facing, I would not recommend you to try it.
</p>

<p>
P.S. I found this article when I was listening to an episode of the
Bike Shed: <a href="http://bikeshed.fm/197">197: Don't Go Chasing Waterfalls - The Bike Shed</a>. And I
remembered they've talked about similar topics for more than
once. Here is another one that I like:

<p>
The idea of <i>ephemeralization</i> resonates with my current world view
perfectly. I believe that we need to simplify our life, work, product,
software, codebase, and you name it, by abstracting constantly so that
we can do more with less. It's not easy (simple != easy), but rather
extremely hard. So we need to try our best.
</p>

<p>
I've been reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Company-One-Staying-Small-Business-ebook/dp/B078962RHQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525875626&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=company+of+one&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=eik05-20&amp;linkId=470605f6117f60ed70b3b4268f0e78d1">Company of One: Why Staying Small Is the Next Big
Thing for Business</a> this month. And <i>ephemeralization</i> is an important
idea behind it as well. Given all the possible technologies we have
nowadays, we can get more business outcomes without adding more to the
company, to our work. Instead, we can achieve more by doing less, and
focusing on improving our core product, providing more values to our
existing customers.

<p>
A great summarize of my current understanding of software
engineering. I hope I could write an article like this someday.
</p>

<p>
BTW, I think the same idea can be applied to company growth as
well. As it's explained in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Company-One-Staying-Small-Business-ebook/dp/B078962RHQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525875626&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=company+of+one&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=eik05-20&amp;linkId=470605f6117f60ed70b3b4268f0e78d1">Company of One: Why Staying Small Is the
Next Big Thing for Business</a>, building better product with all the
resources we have now is a way of improving a company's internal
quality. And just like software, only with a great internal quality,
can a company last longer and become more successful.

<p>
Only one day after I published <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/06/10/say-no-to-processes/">Say NO to Processes</a>, I read this
article. And it advocated basically the same idea: <b>Process itself is

</p>

<p>
And if you want to know more about how I want to arrange a meeting,
you can check this article I wrote: <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2018/11/15/similarities_between_tdd_and_management/">Similarities between TDD and

<p>
I can definitely resonate with this motto after several failed
attempts to advocate testing, TDD or code reviews to other developers
in my team. Most of the time, it's not enough to give reasons for a
transition, even if these reasons are logically perfect.
</p>

<p>
The most efficient way I found is to:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Do it by yourself first and set an example.</li>
<li>Do it with others together and create experiences for him/her.</li>

<p>
It can be extremely hard to successfully join a team as a leader.

<p>
This article gives some useful tasks that you can work on to secure
some early wins. From my experience of working on hiring and training,
they are not easy, but they are super useful. I'd highly recommend
them if you also just started your leadership journey as well.

I've been <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/05/07/clippings-from-measure-what-matters/">learning</a> and <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2019/05/16/defining-a-mvp-by-setting-okrs/">practicing</a> OKRs recently. Like any tools and
processes, OKR cannot guarantee a great outcome (which is why we
should <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/06/10/say-no-to-processes/">Say NO to Processes</a>). It all comes down to the people who are
using it. To learn a process like OKR or Scrum, we really need to
learn the <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/04/11/values-and-practices/">values behind its practices</a>.
