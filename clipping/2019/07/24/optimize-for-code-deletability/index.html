            <h1>Optimize for Code Deletability</h1>
            <p>
It's not my first time to talk about this idea in this blog:
<i>we should optimize our code for its deletability, reversibility,
replacability, etc.</i>
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">

<li><a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/01/09/don't-rewrite-replace/">Don't Rewrite, Replace - dsdshome</a></li>
</ol>

<p>
Yet this post is my another attempt to connect the dots around this
idea about <b>deletability</b>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3b0e865" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3b0e865">Why is deletable code great?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3b0e865">
<p>
It all comes down to changeability and maintainability.
</p>

<p>
In his great talk about <a href="https://vimeo.com/108441214">the art of destroying software</a>, Greg Young
mentioned that the philosophies behind Erlang, Microservices, OOP,
Unix are all the same: <i>Writing code for the purpose of deleting
it</i>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Writing code for the purpose of deleting it
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Erlang</li>
<li>Microservices</li>
<li>Objects (in Smalltalk)</li>
<li>Unix</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to optimize for deletability?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Decouple</li>
<li>18-month project -&gt; 1-week project</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Benefits
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reduce your fears</li>
<li>Increase your velocity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The difference between great code and sucky code is only the size
of the program.</li>
<li>Don't try to predict the future. Optimize for re-writability.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
This idea resonated with my personal experiences pretty well. When
I first started learning programming, I wished to write a program
that can be used for decades without changing a single line of code
for it. This wish turns out to be somewhat naive, because in the
real life, most of the requirements are constantly changing and so
would our implementations. The best we can do is to make our code
easy to change.
</p>

<p>
Code that's easy to delete is easy to replace or change. We can
delete the part which doesn't meet our new requirement and write a
new one to replace it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org3f31a3d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3f31a3d">How to write deletable code?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3f31a3d">
<p>
Then the question becomes: <i>How to write deletable code to make our
codebase more maintainable?</i>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
TDD &amp; TCR
</p>

<p>
We can understand TDD from the perspective of code deletability as
well: all the tests we write is to make our life easier when we
delete a portion of our code. These failed tests would point us to
the broken part of our application caused by the deletion.
</p>

<p>
When Justin Searls introduced <a href="http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2015-09-10-how-i-use-test-doubles.html">his favorite way to TDD</a>, he also had
this exactly the same idea: when he needed to update a piece of
feature, he would first find the minimal sub-tree of classes in his
application that affects this feature, delete it, and rewrite it
completely.
</p>

<p>
He thought it was one of the drawbacks of London-school TDD
compared to Detroit-school TDD: <i>Radical implementation changes
favor rewrites over refactors</i>. But it might be a major win if we
want our code to be deletable, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
Then, TCR (Test &amp;&amp; Commit || revert) got introduced recently as a
successor for TDD. The idea of TCR is simple: automatically revert
to the latest stable point when the new change introduces any test
failure.
</p>

<p>
When <a href="https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864">Kent Beck introduced this new workflow</a>, he said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s kind of nice to have incorrect code instantly deleted. If you
don’t want a bunch of code wiped out then don’t write a bunch of
code between greens.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In another word, TCR is a workflow that forces us to <b>embrace
code-deletion</b>. You need to think hard about how to organize your
code and how to make your changes so that you are no longer afraid
of the code-deletion.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Single Responsibility Principle
</p>

<p>
I also realized that Single Responsibility Principle was also about
code-deletability as well. Only when the code we need to delete has
a single responsibility, can we delete it without the fear of
affecting other irrelevant responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
The philosophies mentioned in <a href="https://vimeo.com/108441214">the art of destroying software</a> are
great examples for SRP:
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Unix</dt><dd>Do one thing and do it well.</dd>
<dt>Erlang</dt><dd><a href="http://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf">Each real world concurrent activity should be mapped
onto exactly one concurrent process in our programming
language.</a></dd>
<dt>Microservices</dt><dd>Each microservices has only one single
responsibility.</dd>
<dt>OOP</dt><dd><a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2018/09/05/monolithic-repositories.html">Multiple objects are better than a single large one.</a></dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
And to keep things small is just an over-simplified version of SRP:
if a thing is too big, then it's a smell that it has more than one
responsibilities.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Don't rewrite, replace!
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html">StranglerApplication</a> mentioned by Martin Fowler is a great
technique to refactor a large application. And it's exactly a
thinking of making code deletable first, and then delete it.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Code-deletion can happen on the fly
</p>

<p>
Finally, there is a trend to embrace the fact that code is going to
be deleted, and the deletion may happen on the fly.
</p>

<p>
Take Netflix's <a href="https://github.com/netflix/chaosmonkey">chaosmonkey</a> for example, it's an extreme of deleting
the code when the app is running. And by simulating these extreme
cases actively, we as developers can build a resilient system.
</p>

<p>
Erlang's <a href="http://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf">"Let it fail" philosophy</a> is based on the same assumption:
failure is inevitable. When a failure happens, it's no different
than this part of code is deleted. So Erlang developers struct
their apps with tons of small processes and a Supervision Tree to
make sure the "code gets deleted" is minimum and we can restore it
back easily.

<h2 id="orgbddf1a2">Bonus: A CTO needs to help the team write less code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbddf1a2">
<p>
Based on this thinking, we can get a simplified answer for "What's a
CTO's responsibility?"
</p>

<p>
I believe a CTO is responsible for an organization's technical
excellence. And to make a team become more tech efficient, a CTO needs
to help everyone write less code.
</p>

<p>
She can build a framework around the domain the team is working on.
</p>

<p>
She can introduce new technologies (languages, libraries, tools,
processes, etc.) to the team.
</p>

<p>
She can help cut the scope of a project and define the MVP.
</p>

<p>
But the goals are the same: to write less code and get more things
done.
