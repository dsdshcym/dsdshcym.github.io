            <h1>How to Apply OKRs Practically? (Book Review: Radical Focus)</h1>
            <p>
After I learned <a href="/clipping/2019/05/07/clippings-from-measure-what-matters/">what OKR is</a>, I felt excited and started immediately
preaching OKRs and applying them in my work.
</p>

<p>
The result was not very exciting. I found it was really hard to
convince people to start using it. At its core, <a href="/clipping/2019/07/03/clippings-of-2019-jun/#orge6ea9b2">OKRs is just a way to
set goals and review them regularly</a>. It seems natural and obvious to
me. But some people don't believe in planning and prefers a more
"agile" way of doing things. Or some people just don't write down
their goals and review them regularly. Though I personally have <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/my-gtd-workflow-2019-ver/">some
experiences with setting goals and reviewing them</a>, I can't easily
change the working style people are already familiar with.
</p>

<p>
<i><a href="/clipping/2019/05/07/clippings-from-measure-what-matters/">Measure What Matters</a></i> can't help me much in these cases. It is a
great book. But most of this book is just stories about how a company
became successful with OKRs. It doesn't provide enough directions on
how to use OKRs.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, I found <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0996006028/">Radical Focus</a></i> right after I finished <i><a href="/clipping/2019/05/07/clippings-from-measure-what-matters/">Measure
What Matters</a></i>. And it answers exactly the question I had: How to apply
OKRs practically?
</p>

<p>
So, if you are like me, also want to know how to set stretched goals
and achieve them with your team, read this book!

<h2 id="org4e1715d">Bonus: Some highlights from this book</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4e1715d">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5da36d0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5da36d0">Turn important things into urgent things</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5da36d0">
<blockquote>
<p>
Tying Actions to Goals
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It’s mentally quite difficult to drop things that don’t matter
(especially if someone is nagging us). So a solution is to
<b>time-constrain things that are important but not urgent, thus
making them urgent.</b></li>
<li>if you review the priorities each week, you discover
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>what conditions allow you to achieve them.</li>
<li>what keeps you from getting things done. (more valuable)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
When I read about this, I just finished <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/my-gtd-workflow-2019-ver/">the summary for my GTD
workflow</a>. And the idea behind my workflow is exactly the same as
above:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>turn important but less urgent things into urgent things by
setting deadlines</li>
<li>filter out things that seem to be important by reviewing often
and spotting deadline slips.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2cf1b95" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2cf1b95">OKRs are about continuous improvement</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2cf1b95">
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>OKRs are about continuous improvement and learning cycles.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So you didn’t hit any of your KRs. Ask yourself why, and fix it.</li>
<li>So you hit them all? Set harder goals, and move on.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Focus on learning, getting smarter and having better things to
celebrate every Friday.</b></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Continuous improvement is the key for both operations and
individuals. And it's mentioned in multiple books covering
different topics:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<a href="/clipping/2019/04/07/clippings-from-accelerate-the-science-of-lean-software-and-dev-ops/#org206a954">Accelerate - TIPS TO IMPROVE CULTURE AND SUPPORT YOUR TEAMS</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Help create a climate of learning
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Creating a training budget and advocating for it internally</li>
<li>Ensuring that your team has the resources to engage in informal
learning and the space to explore ideas.</li>
<li>Making it safe to fail.</li>
<li>Creating opportunities and spaces to share information</li>
<li>Encourage sharing and innovation by having demo days and forums</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Feedback-Science-Receiving-Well/dp/0670014664">Thanks for the Feedback - PULL TOGETHER: Feedback in Organizations</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
PROMOTE A CULTURE OF LEARNERS
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In every organization explicit and implicit messages evolve
about what is (actually) valued and what is (actually)
rewarded.</li>
<li>If you want “learning” to be valued, it has to be embedded
in
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>what is talked about with admiration,</li>
<li>what is highlighted as important in the war stories that
are told,</li>
<li>what matters when it comes to visible projects and key
promotions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Here are five ideas that help promote a culture of learning.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Highlight Learning Stories</li>
<li>Cultivate Growth Identities</li>
<li>Discuss Second Scores</li>
<li>Create Multitrack Feedback</li>
<li>Leverage Positive Social Norming</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>
To achieve this continuous improvement in our organizations, we need
to have <b>continuous conversations</b> with our team members or a
Continuous Performance Management system:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0996006028/">Radical Focus - OKRs and the Annual Review</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Instead of a one-time performance review event, use <b>continuous
conversations</b> to coach and calibrate.</li>
<li>Have 1-on-1’s <b>at least twice a month</b> and calibrate on three
things:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>engagement</li>
<li>performance</li>
<li>alignment</li>
</ol></li>
<li>End of year, your employees had 24 conversations with
opportunities to improve and recognition -- it’s more authentic,
builds skill and improves performance.</li>
<li>Reviews are simple because the facts are shared, there are no
surprises and it is just another in a series of performance
conversations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="/clipping/2019/05/07/clippings-from-measure-what-matters/#org3327442">Measure What Matters - Continuous Performance Management</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We need a new HR model for the new world of work.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Annual performance reviews are costly, exhausting, and mostly
futile.</li>
<li><b>individuals cannot be reduced to numbers.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>That transformational system, the contemporary alternative to annual
reviews, is <i>continuous performance management</i></li>
<li>It is implemented with an instrument called CFRs, for:
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Conversations</dt><dd>an authentic, richly textured exchange between
manager and contributor, aimed at driving
performance</dd>
<dt>Feedback</dt><dd>bidirectional or networked communication among peers
to evaluate progress and guide future improvement</dd>
<dt>Recognition</dt><dd>expressions of appreciation to deserving
individuals for contributions of all sizes</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul>
