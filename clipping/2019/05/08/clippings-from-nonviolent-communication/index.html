The Heart of Nonviolent Communication

<p>
What I want in my life is compassion, a flow between myself and
others based on a mutual giving from the heart.

<h3 id="orgffa84be">Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgffa84be">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Believing that it is our nature to enjoy giving and receiving in a
compassionate manner, I have been preoccupied most of my life with
two questions:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What happens to disconnect us from our compassionate nature,
leading us to behave violently and exploitatively?</li>
<li>And conversely, what allows some people to stay connected to
their compassionate nature under even the most trying
circumstances?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>While studying the factors that affect our ability to stay
compassionate,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I was struck by the crucial role of language and our use of words</li>
<li>I have since identified a <i>specific approach to communicating</i>
that <b>leads us to give from the heart</b>, connecting us with
ourselves and with each other in a way that allows natural
compassion to flourish</li>
<li>I call this approach <i>Nonviolent Communication</i> (NVC)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>using the term <i>nonviolence</i> as Gandhi used it</li>
<li>to refer to our natural state of compassion when violence has
subsided from the heart</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="orga2c50ba">A Way to Focus Attention</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga2c50ba">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It contains nothing new;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>all that has been integrated into NVC has been known for centuries</li>
<li>The intent is to
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>remind us about what we already know
(how we humans were meant to relate to one another)</li>
<li>assist us in living in a way that concretely manifests this
knowledge</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and hear others
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Instead of habitual, automatic reactions, our words become
conscious responses based firmly on awareness of what we are
perceiving, feeling, and wanting</li>
<li>We are led to express ourselves with honesty and clarity, while
simultaneously paying others a respectful and empathetic
attention.</li>
<li>In any exchange, we come to hear our own deeper needs and those of
others</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NVC trains us to observe carefully, and to be able to specify
behaviors and conditions that are affecting us.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We learn to identify and clearly articulate what we are concretely
wanting in any given situation</li>
<li>The form is simple, yet powerfully transformative</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing, or
attacking in the face of judgment and criticism, we come to perceive
ourselves and others, as well as our intentions and relationships,
in a new light</li>
<li>On a deeper level, it is an ongoing reminder to
<b>keep our attention focused on a place where we are more likely to
get what we are seeking.</b></li>
<li>When we give from the heart, we do so out of the joy that springs
forth whenever we willingly enrich another person’s life. This kind
of giving benefits both the giver and the receiver.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The receiver enjoys the gift without worrying about the
consequences that accompany gifts given out of fear, guilt, shame,
or desire for gain.</li>
<li>The giver benefits from the enhanced self-esteem that results when
we see our efforts contributing to someone’s well-being.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The use of NVC does not require that the persons with whom we are
communicating be literate in NVC or even motivated to relate to us
compassionately.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org502ef4c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org502ef4c">The NVC Process</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org502ef4c">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Four components of NVC:
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>observations</dt><dd>The concrete actions we observe that affect our
well-being
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The trick is to be able to articulate this observation without
introducing any judgment or evaluation</li>
<li>to simply say what people are doing that we either like or
don’t like</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>feelings</dt><dd>How we feel in relation to what we observe
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we state how we feel when we observe this action:</li>
<li>are we hurt, scared, joyful, amused, irritated?</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>needs</dt><dd>The needs, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we say what needs of ours are connected to the feelings we have
identified.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>requests</dt><dd>The concrete actions we request in order to enrich our
lives
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a very specific request</li>
<li>what we are wanting from the other person that would enrich our
lives or make life more wonderful for us.</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Two parts of NVC:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>expressing honestly through the four components</li>
<li>receiving empathically through the four components</li>
</ol></li>
<li>As we keep our attention focused on the areas mentioned, and help
others do likewise, we establish a flow of communication, back and
forth, until compassion manifests naturally:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>what I am observing, feeling, and needing; what I am requesting
to enrich my life;</li>
<li>what you are observing, feeling, and needing; what you are
requesting to enrich your life …</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The essence of NVC is in our consciousness of the four components,
not in the actual words that are exchanged.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="example">
1. Felix, when I see two balls of soiled socks under the coffee table and another three next to the TV,
2. I feel irritated
3. because I am needing more order in the rooms that we share in common.
4. Would you be willing to put your socks in your room or in the washing machine?

<h3 id="org4d3d52b">Applying NVC in Our Lives and the World</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4d3d52b">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is therefore an approach that can be effectively applied at all
levels of communication and in diverse situations:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>intimate relationships</li>
<li>families</li>
<li>schools</li>
<li>organizations and institutions</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org06afe3a">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NVC helps us connect with each other and ourselves in a way that
allows our natural compassion to flourish.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It guides us to reframe the way we express ourselves and listen to
others by focusing our consciousness on four areas: what we are
observing, feeling, and needing, and what we are requesting to
enrich our lives</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NVC fosters deep listening, respect, and empathy and engenders a
mutual desire to give from the heart.</li>
<li>NVC is not simply a language or a set of techniques for using words;
the consciousness and intent that it embraces may be expressed
through silence, a quality of presence, as well as through facial
expressions and body language</li>

<ul class="org-ul">

<h3 id="org1a6f9d1">Moralistic Judgments</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1a6f9d1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One kind of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic
judgments that <i>imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who
don't act in harmony with our values.</i></li>
<li>Such judgments are reflected in language:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"The problem with you is that you're too selfish."</li>
<li>"She's lazy."</li>
<li>"They're prejudiced."</li>
<li>"It's inappropriate."</li>

<li>All forms of judgment

<li>put-downs</li>
<li>labels</li>
<li>criticism</li>
<li>comparisons</li>
<li>diagnoses</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the world of judgments, our concern centers on "who is what."
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is a language rich with words that classify and dichotomize
people and their actions.</li>
<li>When we speak this language, we judge others and their behavior
while preoccupying ourselves with who's good, bad, normal,
abnormal, responsible, irresponsible, smart, ignorant, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When we speak this language, we think and communicate in terms of
what's wrong with others for behaving in certain ways or,
occasionally, what's wrong with ourselves for not understanding or
responding as we would like.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our attention is focused on classifying, analyzing, and
determining levels of wrongness rather than on what we and others
need and are not getting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and
values.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They are tragic because when we express our values and needs in
this form, we increase defensiveness and resistance among the very
people whose behaviors are of concern to us.</li>
<li>Or, if people do agree to act in harmony with our values, they
will likely do so out of fear, guilt, or shame because they concur
with our analysis of their wrongness.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We all pay dearly when people respond to our values and needs
not out of a desire to give from the heart, but out of fear,
guilt, or shame.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sooner or later, we will experience the consequences of
diminished goodwill on the part of those who comply with our
values out of a sense of either external or internal coercion.</li>
<li>They, too, pay emotionally, for they are likely to feel
resentment and decreased self-esteem when they respond to us
out of fear, guilt, or shame.</li>
<li>Furthermore, each time others associate us in their minds with
any of those feelings, the likelihood of their responding
compassionately to our needs and values in the future
decreases.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is important here not to confuse <i>value judgments</i> and
<i>moralistic judgments</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All of us make value judgments as to the qualities we value in
life;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we might value honesty, freedom, or peace.</li>
<li>Value judgments reflect our beliefs of how life can best be
served.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We make moralistic judgments of people and behaviors that fail to
support our value judgments;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Violence is bad. People who kill others are evil."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Had we been raised speaking a language that facilitated the
expression of compassion, we would have learned to articulate our
needs and values directly, rather than to insinuate wrongness when
they have not been met.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>instead of "Violence is bad," we might say instead, "I am
fearful of the use of violence to resolve conflicts; I value the
resolution of human conflicts through other means."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The relationship between language and violence
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>study shows a high correlation between frequent use of such words
(that classify and judge people) and frequency of incidents.</li>
<li>there is considerably less violence in cultures where people think
in terms of human needs than in cultures where people label one
another as "good" or "bad" and believe that the "bad" ones deserve
to be punished.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Classifying and judging people promotes violence.</li>
<li>At the root of much, if not all, violence is
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>a kind of thinking that attributes the cause of conflict to
wrongness in one's adversaries</b>,</li>
<li>a corresponding inability to think of oneself or others in terms
of vulnerability—that is, what one might be feeling, fearing,
yearning for, missing, etc.</li>

<dt>Vague, impersonal forces</dt><dd>"I cleaned my room because I had to."</dd>
<dt>Our condition, diagnosis, or personal or psychological history</dt><dd>"I drink because I am an alcoholic."</dd>

<dt>Uncontrollable impulses</dt><dd>"I was overcome by my urge to eat the candy bar."</dd>

<li><p>
We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language
that acknowledges choice.

<pre class="example">
I suggested that the teacher translate the statement "I have to give
grades because it's district policy" to "I choose to give grades
because I want … " She answered without hesitation, "I choose to give
grades because I want to keep my job," while hastening to add, "But I
don't like saying it that way. It makes me feel so responsible for
what I'm doing."

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3627d5e">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Communicating our desires as demands
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A demand explicitly or implicitly threatens listeners with blame
or punishment if they fail to comply.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I couldn't make them do anything.</li>
<li>All I could do was make them wish they had—through punishment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is a common form of communication in our culture, especially
among those who hold positions of authority.</li>
<li>We will examine this subject again when we learn to differentiate
requests from demands</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The concept that certain actions merit reward while others merit
punishment
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This thinking is expressed by the word deserve as in "He deserves
to be punished for what he did."</li>
<li>Thinking based on "who deserves what" blocks compassionate
communication.</li>
<li>It assumes "badness" on the part of people who behave in certain
ways,</li>
<li>it calls for punishment to make them repent and change their
behavior.</li>
<li>*it is in everyone's interest that people change, not in order to
avoid punishment, but because they see the change as benefiting
themselves.*</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Life-alienating communication has deep philosophical and political
roots.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most of us grew up speaking a language that encourages us to
label, compare, demand, and pronounce judgments rather than to be
aware of what we are feeling and needing.</li>
<li>I believe life-alienating communication is rooted in views of
human nature that have exerted their influence for several
centuries.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These views stress humans' innate evil and deficiency, and a
need for education to control our inherently undesirable nature.</li>
<li>Such education often leaves us questioning whether there is
something wrong with whatever feelings and needs we may be
experiencing.</li>
<li>We learn early to cut ourselves off from what's going on within
ourselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Life-alienating communication both stems from and supports
hierarchical or domination societies, where large populations are
controlled by a small number of individuals to those individuals,
own benefit.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It would be in the interest of kings, czars, nobles, and so
forth that the masses be educated in a way that renders them
slavelike in mentality.</li>
<li>The language of wrongness, should, and have to is perfectly
suited for this purpose:</li>
<li>the more people are trained to think in terms of moralistic
judgments that imply wrongness and badness, the more they are
being trained to look outside themselves—to outside
authorities—for the definition of what constitutes right, wrong,
good, and bad.</li>
<li>When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we humans no
longer make good slaves and underlings.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Summary
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is our nature to enjoy giving and receiving compassionately.</li>
<li>We have, however, learned many forms of life-alienating
communication that lead us to speak and behave in ways that injure
others and ourselves.</li>

<h2 id="orgb811177">3 Observing Without Evaluating</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb811177">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We need to clearly observe what we are seeing, hearing, or touching
that is affecting our sense of well-being, without mixing in any
evaluation.</li>
<li>When we combine observation with evaluation, we decrease the
likelihood that others will hear our intended message. Instead, they
are apt to hear criticism and thus resist whatever we are saying.</li>
<li>NVC does not mandate that we remain completely objective and refrain
from evaluating.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It only requires that we maintain a separation between our
observations and our evaluations.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NVC is a process language that discourages static
generalizations;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>instead, evaluations are to be based on observations <i>specific
to time and context</i>.</li>
<li>we create many problems for ourselves by using static language
to express or capture a reality that is ever changing:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>While the effects of negative labels such as "lazy" and "stupid" may
be more obvious, even a positive or an apparently neutral label such
as "cook" limits our perception of the totality of another person's
being.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Distinguish feelings from thoughts</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A common confusion, generated by the English language, is our use
of the word <i>feel</i> without actually expressing a feeling.</li>
<li>In general, feelings are not being clearly expressed when the word
feel is followed by:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Words such as <i>that</i>, <i>like</i>, <i>as if</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"I feel <i>that</i> you should know better."</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Distinguish between what we feel and what we think we are.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Conversely, in the English language, it is not necessary to use
the word feel at all when we are actually expressing a feeling:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we can say, "I’m feeling irritated,"</li>
<li>or simply, "I’m irritated."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In NVC, we distinguish between words that express actual feelings
and those that describe <i>what we think we are</i>.

</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or

<h3 id="org18fdf5b">Hearing a Negative Message: Four Options</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org18fdf5b">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The third component of NVC entails <b>the acknowledgment of the root
of our feelings</b>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>What others say and do may be the <i>stimulus</i>, but never the
<i>cause</i>, of our feelings.</b></li>
<li>We see that our feelings result from
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>how we choose to receive what others say and do</li>
<li>our particular needs and expectations in that moment</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Four options for receiving negative messages:
</p>
<pre class="example">
You're the most self-centered person I've ever met!
</pre>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
blame ourselves
</p>
<pre class="example">
Oh, I should've been more sensitive!
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>take it (negative message) personally by hearing blame and
criticism.</li>
<li>accept the other person's judgment and blame ourselves.</li>
<li><b>We choose this option at great cost to our self-esteem, for it
inclines us toward feelings of guilt, shame, and depression.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
blame others
</p>
<pre class="example">
You have no right to say that! I am always considering your
needs. You're the one who is really self-centered.
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we receive messages this way, we are likely to feel anger</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
sense our own feelings and needs
</p>
<pre class="example">
When I hear you say that I am the most self-centered person you've
ever met, I feel hurt, because I need some recognition of my efforts
to be considerate of your preferences.
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By focusing attention on our own feelings and needs, we become
conscious that our current feeling of hurt derives from a need
for our efforts to be recognized.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
sense others' feelings and needs
</p>
<pre class="example">
Are you feeling hurt because you need more consideration for your
preferences?
</pre></li>
</ol></li>
<li>We accept responsibility for our feelings, rather than blame other
people, <b>by acknowledging our own needs, desires, expectations,
values, or thoughts.</b></li>
<li>Connect your feeling with your need: "I feel...because I need..."
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As we shall see, the more we are able to connect our feelings to
our own needs, <b>the easier it is for others to respond
compassionately.</b></li>
<li>It is helpful to recognize a number of common speech patterns that
tend to mask accountability for our own feelings:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Use of impersonal pronouns such as <i>it</i> and <i>that</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"It really infuriates me when spelling mistakes appear in our
public brochures."</li>
<li>"That bugs me a lot."</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
The use of the expression "I feel (an emotion) because … "
followed by a person or personal pronoun other than I:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"I feel hurt because you said you don't love me."</li>
<li>"I feel angry because the supervisor broke her promise."</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
Statements that mention only the actions of others:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"When you don't call me on my birthday, I feel hurt."</li>
<li>"Mommy is disappointed when you don't finish your food."</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
In each of these instances, we can deepen our awareness of our own
responsibility by substituting the phrase, "I feel … because I … "
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"I feel really infuriated when spelling mistakes like that
appear in our public brochures, because I want our company to
project a professional image."</li>
<li>"I feel angry that the supervisor broke her promise, because I
was counting on getting that long weekend to visit my brother."</li>
<li>"Mommy feels disappointed when you don't finish your food,
because I want you to grow up strong and healthy."</li>
</ol>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated by
guilt.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The basic mechanism of motivating by guilt is to attribute the
responsibility for one's own feelings to others.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When parents say,
"It hurts Mommy and Daddy when you get poor grades at school,"
they are implying that the child's actions are the cause of the
parents' happiness or unhappiness.</li>
<li>On the surface, taking responsibility for the feelings of others
can easily be mistaken for positive caring.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It may appear that the child cares for the parent and feels
bad because the parent is suffering.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, if children who assume this kind of responsibility
change their behavior in accordance with parental wishes, they
are not acting from the heart, but acting to avoid guilt.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="orga26e51f">The Needs at the Roots of Feelings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga26e51f">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet
needs.</b></li>
<li>If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them
met.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we express our needs indirectly through the use of
evaluations, interpretations, and images, others are likely to
hear criticism.</li>
<li>And when people hear anything that sounds like criticism, they
tend to invest their energy in self-defense or counterattack.</li>
<li>If we wish for a compassionate response from others, it is
self-defeating to express our needs by interpreting or diagnosing
their behavior.</li>
<li>Instead, the more directly we can connect our feelings to our own
needs, the easier it is for others to respond to us
compassionately.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, most of us have never been taught to think in terms
of needs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are accustomed to thinking about what’s wrong with other
people when our needs aren’t being fulfilled.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thus, if we want coats to be hung up in the closet, we may
characterize our children as lazy for leaving them on the
couch.</li>
<li>Or we may interpret our co-workers as irresponsible when they
don’t go about their tasks the way we would prefer them to.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9551d34">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In our development toward a state of emotional liberation, most of
us experience <i>three stages in the way we relate to others</i>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Emotional slavery</dt><dd>We see ourselves responsible for others' feelings
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We think we must constantly strive to keep everyone happy. If
they don’t appear happy, we feel responsible and compelled to do
something about it.</li>
<li>This can easily lead us to see the very people who are closest
to us as burdens.</li>
<li><p>
Taking responsibility for the feelings of others can be very
detrimental to <i>intimate relationships</i>.
</p>
<pre class="example">
“I’m really scared to be in a relationship. Every time I see my
partner in pain or needing something, I feel overwhelmed. I feel like
I’m in prison, that I’m being smothered—and I just have to get out of
the relationship as fast as possible.”
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This response is common among those who experience love as
denial of one’s own needs in order to attend to the needs of
the beloved.</li>
<li>In the early days of a relationship, partners typically relate
joyfully and compassionately to each other out of a sense of
freedom.</li>
<li>The relationship is exhilarating, spontaneous, wonderful.</li>
<li>Eventually, however, as the relationship becomes “serious,”
partners may begin to assume responsibility for each other’s
feelings.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>The obnoxious stage</dt><dd>We feel angry; we no longer want to be responsible for others'
feelings
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are clear what we are <i>not responsible for</i>, but have yet to
learn <i>how to be responsible to others</i> in a way that is not
emotionally enslaving.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In this stage, we become aware of the high costs of assuming
responsibility for others’ feelings and trying to accommodate
them at our own expense.</li>
<li>When we notice how much of our lives we’ve missed and how little
we have responded to the call of our own soul, we may get angry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As we emerge from the stage of emotional slavery, we may
continue to carry remnants of fear and guilt around having our
own needs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thus it is not surprising that we end up expressing our needs
in ways that sound rigid and unyielding to the ears of others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Honesty would be a gift more precious to others than
accommodating them to prevent their upset.</b></li>
<li>empathize with people when they were upset without taking
responsibility for their feelings.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Emotional liberation</dt><dd>We take responsibility for our intentions and actions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We respond to the needs of others out of compassion, never out
of fear, guilt, or shame.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our actions are therefore fulfilling to us, as well as to those
who receive our efforts.</li>
<li>We accept full responsibility for our own intentions and
actions, but not for the feelings of others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At this stage, we are aware that <b>we can never meet our own
needs at the expense of others.</b></li>
<li>Emotional liberation involves
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>stating clearly what we need</li>
<li>in a way that communicates we are equally concerned that the
needs of others be fulfilled.</li>

<li>We talk <i>to</i> others or <i>at</i> them without knowing how to engage in

you from seeing things, especially when you're on your bike. How

<h3 id="org0bf377d">Presence: Don’t Just Do Something, Stand There</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0bf377d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Empathy: emptying our mind and listening with our whole being
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Way_of_Chuang_Tz%C5%AD.html?id=LDOCZPyg2MQC">The Chinese philosopher Chuang-Tzu stated</a> that true empathy
requires listening with the whole being:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The hearing that is only in the ears is one thing. The hearing of
the understanding is another. But the hearing of the spirit is not
limited to any one faculty, to the ear, or to the mind. Hence it
demands the emptiness of all the faculties. And when the faculties
are empty, then the whole being listens. There is then a direct
grasp of what is right there before you that can never be heard
with the ear or understood with the mind.”
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Empathy with others occurs only when we have successfully shed all
preconceived ideas and judgments about them.</li>
<li>“In spite of all similarities, every living situation has, like a
newborn child, a new face, that has never been before and will
never come again. It demands of you a reaction that cannot be
prepared beforehand. It demands nothing of what is past. It
demands presence, responsibility; it demands you.” Martin Buber</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The presence that empathy requires is not easy to maintain.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Instead of offering empathy, we tend instead to give advice or
reassurance and to explain our own position or feeling.</li>
<li>Empathy, on the other hand, requires us to focus full attention on
the other person’s message.</li>
<li>We give to others the time and space they need to express
themselves fully and to feel understood.</li>
<li>There is a Buddhist saying that aptly describes this ability:
“Don’t just do something, stand there.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ask before offering advice or reassurance.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is often frustrating for someone needing empathy to have us
assume that they want reassurance or “fix-it” advice.</li>
<li>check whether advice or reassurance is wanted before offering any.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>some common behaviors that prevent us from being sufficiently
present to connect empathically with others.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Advising: “I think you should … ” “How come you didn’t … ?”</li>
<li>One-upping: “That’s nothing; wait’ll you hear what happened to
me.”</li>
<li>Educating: “This could turn into a very positive experience for
you if you just … ”</li>
<li>Consoling: “It wasn’t your fault; you did the best you could.”</li>
<li>Story-telling: “That reminds me of the time …  ”</li>
<li>Shutting down: “Cheer up. Don’t feel so bad.”</li>
<li>Sympathizing: “Oh, you poor thing … ”</li>
<li>Interrogating: “When did this begin?”</li>
<li>Explaining: “I would have called but … ”</li>
<li>Correcting: “That’s not how it happened.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Believing we have to “fix” situations and make others feel better
prevents us from being present.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>intellectual understanding of a problem blocks the kind of
presence that empathy requires.</li>
<li>When we are thinking about people’s words and listening to how
they connect to our theories, we are looking at people—we are not
with them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The key ingredient of empathy is <b>presence</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we are wholly present with the other party and what they are
experiencing.</li>
<li>This quality of presence distinguishes empathy from either mental
understanding or sympathy.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While we may choose at times to sympathize with others by
feeling their feelings, it’s helpful to be aware that during the
moment we are offering sympathy, we are not empathizing.</li>

<h3 id="org98ed3c2">Paraphrasing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org98ed3c2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>reflect back by paraphrasing what we have understood.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we have accurately received the other party’s message, our
paraphrasing will confirm this for them.</li>
<li>If, on the other hand, our paraphrase is incorrect, we give the
speaker an opportunity to correct us.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another advantage of choosing to reflect a message back to the other
party is that it offers them time to reflect on what they’ve said
and an opportunity to delve deeper into themselves.</li>
<li>NVC suggests that our paraphrasing take the form of questions that
reveal our understanding while eliciting any necessary corrections
from the speaker.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Questions may focus on these components:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>what others are observing: “Are you reacting to how many
evenings I was gone last week?”</li>
<li>how others are feeling and the needs generating their feelings:
“Are you feeling hurt because you would have liked more
appreciation of your efforts than you received?”</li>
<li>what others are requesting: “Are you wanting me to tell you my
reasons for saying what I did?”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These questions require us to sense what’s going on within other
people, while inviting their corrections should we have sensed
incorrectly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When asking for information, first express our own feelings and
needs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Notice the difference between these questions and the ones below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>“What did I do that you are referring to?”</li>
<li>“How are you feeling?” “Why are you feeling that way?”</li>
<li>“What are you wanting me to do about it?”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Asks for information without first sensing the speaker’s
reality.</li>
<li>Many such questions may give speakers the impression that we’re
a schoolteacher examining them or a psychotherapist working on a
case</li>
</ul></li>
<li>People feel safer if we first reveal the feelings and needs
within ourselves that are generating the question.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>instead of asking someone, “What did I do?”</li>
<li>we might say, “I’m frustrated because I’d like to be clearer
about what you are referring to. Would you be willing to tell
me what I’ve done that leads you to see me in this way?”</li>
<li>I would recommend it particularly during moments when the
questions we ask are accompanied by strong emotions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reflect back messages that are emotionally charged.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are no infallible guidelines regarding when to paraphrase,
but as a rule of thumb, it is safe to assume that speakers
expressing intensely emotional messages would appreciate our
reflecting these back to them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When we ourselves are talking, we can make it easier for the
listener if we clearly signify when we want or don’t want our words
to be reflected back to us</li>
<li>Paraphrase only when it contributes to greater compassion and
understanding</li>
<li>When we paraphrase,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the tone of voice we use is highly important.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When hearing themselves reflected back, people are likely to be
sensitive to the slightest hint of criticism or sarcasm.</li>
<li>They are likewise negatively affected by a declarative tone that
implies that we are telling them what is going on inside of
them.</li>
<li>If we are consciously listening for other people’s feelings and
needs, however, our tone communicates that we’re asking whether
we have understood—not claiming that we have understood.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We also need to be prepared for the possibility that the intention
behind our paraphrasing will be misinterpreted.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Should this occur, we continue our effort to sense the speaker’s
feelings and needs;</li>
<li>Behind intimidating messages are merely people appealing to us
to meet their needs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we receive messages with this awareness, we never feel
dehumanized by what others have to say to us.</li>
<li>We only feel dehumanized when we get trapped in derogatory
images of other people or thoughts of wrongness about
ourselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>A difficult message becomes an opportunity to enrich someone’s
life.</b></li>
<li>If it happens regularly that people distrust our motives and
sincerity when we paraphrase their words, we may need to examine
our own intentions more closely.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If it happens regularly that people distrust our motives and
sincerity when we paraphrase their words, we may need to examine
our own intentions more closely.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Perhaps we are paraphrasing and engaging the components of NVC
in a mechanistic way without maintaining clear consciousness of
purpose.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We might ask ourselves, for example, whether we are more
intent on applying the process "correctly" than on connecting
with the human being in front of us.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Or perhaps, even though we are using the form of NVC, our only
interest is in changing the other person’s behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Paraphrasing saves time
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Studies in labor-management negotiations demonstrate that the time
required to reach conflict resolution is cut in half when each
negotiator agrees, before responding, to accurately repeat what
the previous speaker had said.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One of the hardest messages for many of us to empathize with is
silence.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is especially true when we’ve expressed ourselves vulnerably

being expressed through the silence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs
behind it.</li>
<li>As listeners, we don’t need insights into psychological dynamics or
training in psychotherapy. What is essential is our ability to be
present to what’s really going on within—to the unique feelings and

<p>
Our ability to offer empathy can allow us to stay vulnerable, defuse
potential violence, hear the word <i>no</i> without taking it as a
rejection, revive a lifeless conversation, and even hear the feelings
and needs expressed through silence. Time and again, people transcend
the paralyzing effects of psychological pain when they have sufficient
contact with someone who can hear them empathically.

NVC and other forms of communication.</li>
<li>Hurting people is too superficial.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we are truly angry, we would want a much more powerful way to
fully express ourselves.</li>

of our anger fully and wholeheartedly.</li>

<h3 id="orge806cd6">Distinguishing Stimulus From Cause</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge806cd6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first step to fully expressing anger in NVC is to divorce the
other person from any responsibility for our anger.</li>
<li>We are never angry because of what someone else did.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We rid ourselves of thoughts such as, "He (or she or they) made me
angry when they did that."</li>
<li>Such thinking leads us to express our anger superficially by
blaming or punishing the other person.</li>
<li>the behavior of others may be a stimulus for our feelings, but not
the cause.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To motivate by guilt, mix up stimulus and cause.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In such cultures, it becomes important to trick people into
thinking that we can <i>make</i> others feel a certain way.</li>
<li>The English language facilitates the use of this guilt-inducing
tactic.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"You make me angry." "You hurt me by doing that." "I feel sad
because you did that."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The cause of anger lies in our thinking—in thoughts of blame and
judgment.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anger is generated when we choose the second option: whenever we
are angry, we are finding fault—we are choosing to play God by
judging or blaming the other person for being wrong or deserving
punishment.</li>
<li>it is not the behavior of the other person but our own need that
causes our feeling.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, someone arrives late for an appointment and
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if we need reassurance that she cares about us, we may feel
hurt.</li>
<li>If, instead, our need is to spend time purposefully and
constructively, we may feel frustrated.</li>
<li>But if our need is for thirty minutes of quiet solitude, we
may be grateful for her tardiness and feel pleased.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>When we are connected to our need,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we are in touch with our life energy.</li>
<li>We may have strong feelings, but we are never angry.</li>
<li>Anger is a result of life-alienating thinking that is disconnected
from needs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It indicates that we have moved up to our head to analyze and
judge somebody rather than focus on which of our needs are not
getting met.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge3e0b9d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we judge others, we contribute to violence.</li>

us up—to realize we have a need that isn't being met and that we
are thinking in a way that makes it unlikely to be met.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To fully express anger requires full consciousness of our need.</li>
<li>In addition, energy is required to get the need met.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anger, however, co-opts our energy by directing it toward
punishing people rather than meeting our needs.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb99d381">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In NVC-style conflict resolution, creating a connection between the
people who are in conflict is the most important thing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is what enables all the other steps of NVC to work,</li>
<li>because it's not until you have forged that connection that each
side will seek to know exactly what the other side is feeling and
needing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The parties also need to know from the start that the objective is
<i>not</i> to get the other side to do what they want them to do.</li>
<li>how we ask for change reflects the value system we're trying to
support.</li>
<li>When we see the difference between these two objectives,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we consciously refrain from trying to get a person to do what we
want.</li>
<li>Instead we work to create that quality of mutual concern and
respect where each party thinks their own needs matter and they

are interdependent.</li>

irresolvable are easily resolved.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbf56897">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fundamentally, needs are the resources life requires to sustain
itself.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>physical needs
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>air</li>
<li>water</li>
<li>food</li>

</ul></li>
<li><b>all people basically have the same needs</b> regardless of
nationality, religion, gender, income, education, etc.</li>
<li>The difference between a person's needs and his or her strategy for
fulfilling them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many of us have great difficulty expressing our needs:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we have been taught by society to criticize, insult, and otherwise
(mis)communicate in ways that keep us apart.</li>
<li>In a conflict, both parties usually spend too much time intent on
proving themselves right, and the other party wrong, rather than
paying attention to their own and the other's needs.</li>
<li>And such verbal conflicts can far too easily escalate into
violence—and even war.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In order not to confuse needs and strategies, it is important to
recall that
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>needs contain no reference to anybody taking any particular
action.</i></li>
<li>On the other hand, strategies, which may appear in the form of
requests, desires, wants, and "solutions," refer to <i>specific
actions that specific people may take.</i></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intellectual analysis is often received as criticism.</li>

<h4 id="orgf4edf44">Sensing Others' Needs, No Matter What They're Saying</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf4edf44">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we really want to be of assistance to others, the first thing to
learn is to translate <i>any</i> message into an expression of a need.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The message might take the form of
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>silence</li>
<li>denial</li>
<li>a judgmental remark</li>
<li>a gesture</li>
<li>a request (hopefully)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We hone our skills to hear the need within every message, even if
at first we have to rely on guesses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Learning to recognize the need in statements that don't overtly
express any need.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It takes practice,</li>
<li>and it always involves some guessing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>once each side can state the other side's needs, it would take no
more than twenty minutes for the conflict to come to a resolution.</li>
<li>Criticism and diagnosis get in the way of peaceful resolution of
conflicts.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When either side hears itself criticized, diagnosed, or
interpreted, the energy of the situation will likely turn toward
self-defense and counter-accusations rather than toward
resolution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In fact, when we reflect back incorrect guesses to others,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it may help them get in touch with their true needs.</li>
<li>It takes them out of analysis toward greater connection to life.</li>

<h4 id="org2df2dd6">Have the Needs Been Heard?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2df2dd6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We must not assume that when one party expresses a need clearly,
that the other party hears it accurately.</li>
<li>When we have pain built up over many years, it can get in the way of
our ability to hear clearly, even when what is being expressed is
clear to others.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org2ce6e47" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2ce6e47">Empathy to Ease the Pain That Prevents Hearing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2ce6e47">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People often need empathy before they are able to hear what is being
said.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When people are upset, they often need empathy before they can
hear what is being said to them.</li>
<li>Especially if there is a long history of pain, it is important to
offer enough empathy so that the parties feel reassured that their
pain is being recognized and understood.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Just as we are not trained to express our own needs, most of us have
not been trained in hearing the needs of others.</li>
<li>If we could just say, "Here are the needs of both sides. Here are
the resources. What can be done to meet these needs?," conflicts
would be easily resolved.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But instead, our thinking is focused on dehumanizing one another
with labels and judgments until even the simplest of conflicts

<h3 id="org24a64c3">Using Present and Positive Action Language to Resolve Conflict</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org24a64c3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Once both parties have connected with each other's needs, the next
step is to arrive at strategies that meet those needs.</li>
<li>It's important to avoid moving hastily into strategies,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>as this may result in a compromise that lacks the deep quality of
authentic resolution that is possible.</li>
<li>By fully hearing each other's needs before addressing solutions,
parties in conflict are much more likely to adhere to the
agreements they make to each other.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is the presentation of strategies in clear, present, positive
action language that moves conflicts toward resolution.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A <i>present language</i> statement refers to what is wanted <i>at this
moment</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The use of a present language request that begins with "Would
you be willing to …" helps foster a respectful discussion.</li>
<li>If the other side answers that they are not willing, it invites
the next step of understanding what prevents their willingness.</li>
</ul></li>

the other party, the more effectively we move the conflict toward
resolution.</li>

<h3 id="org5062231">Using Action Verbs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5062231">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action language requires the use of action verbs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I suggest instead the use of action verbs to capture something
that we can see or hear happening— <b>something that can be recorded
with a video camera.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Listening" occurs inside a person's head;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>another person cannot see whether it is happening or not.</li>
<li>One way to determine that someone is actually listening is to
have that person reflect back what had been said: we ask the
person to take an action that we ourselves can see or hear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Non-action language, such as "Give me the freedom to grow" often
exacerbates conflict.</li>
<li>"let" was too vague: "What do you really mean when you say you

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org34c7a49">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Listening carefully to the message behind the "no" helps us
understand the other person's needs: <i>When they say "no," they're
saying they have a need that keeps them from saying "yes"</i> to what
we are asking.</li>
<li>Many mediations I have witnessed consist of waiting for people to
wear down to the point where they'll accept any compromise. This is
very different from a resolution in which everyone's needs are met
and nobody experiences loss.</li>

<h3 id="orga8d5b54">NVC and the Mediator Role</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga8d5b54">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a few things to keep in mind at those times when we want to use our
NVC tools to help two other parties reach a resolution and we take
on the role of mediator.</li>
<li>Your Role, and Trust in the Process
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we are not there to take sides, but
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to support them in hearing each other,</li>
<li>and to help guide them to a solution that meets everyone's
needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Depending on the circumstances, we may also want to convey our
confidence that, if the parties follow the steps of NVC, both of
their needs will be met in the end.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remember: It's Not About Us
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we are not here to accomplish our own goals.</li>
<li>The mediator's role is to create an environment in which the
parties can connect, express their needs, understand each other's
needs, and arrive at strategies to meet those needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Emergency First-Aid Empathy
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>as soon as I express empathy toward one side, it is not unusual
for the other side to immediately accuse me of favoritism.</li>
<li>At this time, what's called for is emergency first-aid empathy.</li>
<li>This might sound like "So you're really annoyed, and you need some
assurance that you're going to get your side on the table?"</li>
<li>It is then helpful to confirm they are in agreement with waiting
by asking, for example, "Are you feeling reassured about that, or
would you like more reassurance that your opportunity to be heard
will come soon?"</li>
<li>We may need to do this repeatedly to keep the mediation on track.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keep Track: Follow the Bouncing Ball
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"follow the bouncing ball": being conscious of where one party
left off so we can return to what that party said after the other
party has been heard.</li>
<li>use a white board or flip chart to capture the essence of what was
spoken by the last speaker who had opportunity to express a
feeling or need.</li>
<li>This form of visual tracking can also serve to reassure both
parties that their needs will be addressed because so often before
we have a chance to fully draw out one party's needs, the other
will be jumping ahead to express themselves.</li>
<li>In this way, everyone can more easily offer their full attention
to what is being expressed in the current moment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keep the Conversation in the Present
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>awareness of the moment:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>who needs what right now?</li>
<li>What are their present requests?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As we move through the mediation process, it is likely that we
will hear a lot of discussion about what happened in the past and
what people want to happen differently in the future.</li>
<li>However, conflict resolution can only happen right now, so now is
where we need to focus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keep Things Moving
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keep the conversation from getting bogged down;</li>
<li>people often think that if they just tell that same story <i>one
more time</i>, they will finally be understood and the other person
will do what they want.</li>
<li>To keep things moving, the mediator needs to ask effective
questions, and when necessary, maintain or even speed up the pace.</li>
<li>Use role-play to speed up the mediation process.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When relying on this method, I periodically turn to the person
whose role I'm playing, addressing them as "my director" to see
how I am doing.</li>
<li>any of us can do it as long as we are in touch with our own
needs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No matter what else is going on, we all have the same needs.</li>
<li>Needs are universal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Role-play is simply putting ourselves in the other person's
shoes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interrupting
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To keep the process on track under such circumstances, we need to
get comfortable with interrupting.</li>
<li>So when both sides are screaming or talking at the same time,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I insert myself: <i>"Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me!"</i></li>
<li>I repeat this as loudly and as often as necessary until I regain
their attention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When we are grabbing their attention, we have to be quick.</li>
<li>We might view our role as that of a translator
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>translating each party's message so as to be understood by the
other.</b></li>
<li>When I do interrupt, I also check that the speaker feels that
I'm translating them accurately.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The purpose of interrupting is to <b>restore the process</b>.</li>

<li>In some situations, however, the opportunity for such dialogue may

</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgb03617b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb03617b">The Thinking Behind the Use of Force</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb03617b">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we exercise the protective use of force, we are focusing on the
life or rights we want to protect, without passing judgment on
either the person or the behavior.</li>
<li>Intention
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The intention behind the protective use of force is <i>to prevent
injury or injustice</i>.</li>
<li>The intention behind the punitive use of force is to cause
individuals to suffer for their perceived misdeeds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assumption
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The assumption behind the protective use of force is that people
behave in ways injurious to themselves and others <i>due to some form
of ignorance.</i>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>a lack of awareness of the consequences of our actions</li>
<li>an inability to see how our needs may be met without injury to
others</li>
<li>the belief that we have the right to punish or hurt others
because they "deserve" it</li>
<li>delusional thinking that involves, for example, hearing a voice
that instructs us to kill someone</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Punitive action, on the other hand, is based on the assumption that
people commit offenses because they are bad or evil, and to correct
the situation, they need to be made to repent.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Their "correction" is undertaken through punitive action
designed to make them
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>suffer enough to see the error of their ways,</li>
<li>repent, and</li>
<li>change.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In practice, however, punitive action, rather than evoking
repentance and learning, is just as likely to generate resentment
and hostility and to reinforce resistance to the very behavior we
are seeking.</li>

<li>Instead, we are focusing upon the consequences, on what might
happen if we fail to take that action.</li>

<li>What do I want this person to do that's different from what he or
she is currently doing?

effective,</li>

influence someone's behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What do I want this person's reasons to be for doing what I'm
asking?

<li>However, with the second question, it becomes evident that
punishment isn't likely to work:</li>
<li>We seldom address the latter question, but when we do, we soon
realize that punishment and reward interfere with people's
ability to do things motivated by the reasons we'd like them to
have.</li>
<li>it is critical to be aware of the importance of people's reasons
for behaving as we request.</li>
<li>NVC, however, fosters a level of moral development based on
autonomy and interdependence, whereby we acknowledge
responsibility for our own actions and are aware that our own

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org423bd8e">
<p>
When we are entangled in critical, blaming, or angry thoughts, it is
difficult to establish a healthy internal environment for ourselves.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Focus on what we want to do rather than what went wrong.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>focus on what we are truly wanting</li>
<li>rather than on what is wrong with others or ourselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Defuse stress by hearing our own feelings and needs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
I was amazed how I could create a less stressful situation for
myself by simply becoming aware of what I was feeling and needing
rather than blaming others.
</p>
<pre class="example">
Everybody who wasn’t driving by my standards was an archenemy, a
villain. Thoughts spewed through my head: “What the hell is the matter
with that guy!? Doesn’t he even watch where he’s driving?” In that
state of mind, all I wanted was to punish the other drivers, and since
I couldn’t do that, the anger lodged in my body and exacted its toll.

                             |
                             |
                             V

“Boy, I am petrified when people drive like that; I really wish they
would see the danger in what they are doing!”
</pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Defuse stress by empathizing with others.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Later I decided to practice empathy toward other drivers and was
rewarded with a gratifying first experience.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>
… the more you become a connoisseur of gratitude, the less you are a
victim of resentment, depression, and despair. Gratitude will act as
an elixir that will gradually dissolve the hard shell of your ego—your
need to possess and control—and transform you into a generous
being. The sense of gratitude produces true spiritual alchemy, makes
us magnanimous—large souled.

<h3 id="org0bddfa1">The Intention Behind the Appreciation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0bddfa1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Compliments are often judgments—however positive-of others.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Such statements are typically uttered as expressions of appreciation
in life-alienating communication
</p>
<pre class="example">
“You did a good job on that report.”
“You are a very sensitive person.”
“It was kind of you to offer me a ride home last evening.”
</pre></li>
<li>recipients of such praise do work harder, but only initially.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Once they sense the manipulation behind the appreciation, their
productivity drops.</li>
<li>What is most disturbing for me, however, is that the beauty of
appreciation is spoiled when people begin to notice the lurking
intent to get something out of them.</li>
<li>Furthermore, when we use positive feedback as a means to
influence others, it may not be clear how they are receiving the
message.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Express appreciation to celebrate, not to manipulate.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our sole intention is to <b>celebrate the way our lives have been
enriched by others.</b></li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfc084e4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NVC clearly distinguishes three components in the expression of
appreciation:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the actions that have contributed to our well-being</li>
<li>the particular needs of ours that have been fulfilled</li>
<li>the pleasureful feelings engendered by the fulfillment of those
needs</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Saying "thank you" in NVC:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This is what you did;</li>
<li>this is what I feel;</li>
<li>this is the need of mine that was met.</li>

<h3 id="org139ec0e">Receiving Appreciation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org139ec0e">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For many of us, it is difficult to receive appreciation gracefully.
(Accustomed to a culture where buying, earning, and deserving are
the standard modes of interchange, we are often uncomfortable with
simple giving and receiving.)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We fret over whether we deserve it.</li>
<li>We worry about what’s being expected of us</li>
<li>We’re nervous about living up to the appreciation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NVC encourages us to receive appreciation with the same quality of
empathy we express when listening to other messages.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We hear what we have done that has contributed to others’
well-being;</li>
<li>we hear their feelings and the needs that were fulfilled.</li>
<li>We take into our hearts the joyous reality that we can each
enhance the quality of others’ lives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Receive appreciation without feelings of superiority or false
humility.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If I am aware that it is this power of God working through me that
gives me the power to enrich life for others, then I may avoid
both the ego trap and the false humility.</li>
<li>Avoid the pitfall of false humility
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear
is that we are powerful beyond measure.</li>
<li>We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within
us. It’s not just in some of us, it is in everyone.</li>
<li>And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other
people permission to do the same.</li>
<li>As we are liberated from our fear, our presence automatically
liberates others.</li>
