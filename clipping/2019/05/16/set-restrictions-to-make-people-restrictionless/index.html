            <h1>Set Restrictions to Make People Restrictionless</h1>
            <p>
Though I have only worked at several "modern" tech companies until
now. I still see some common factors about these companies. One of
them is that they are all "flat", which means there are no vertical
structures, with no managers, and everyone can stand out and improve
any areas of the company as they want.
</p>

<p>
I can get the good will behind the "flat" structure: to trust people
and to not give people restrictions on what they can work on.
</p>

<p>
But it doesn't work in reality, at least from my experiences. People
are still restricted by their roles and just doing their
job. Developers just write code day by day. Designers just sketches
day by day. PMs just have meetings day by day. No one is thinking
about improving the company or even their own work.
</p>

<p>
Why is that? And how to fix it and make people work more effectivly,
to be truly restrictionless?
</p>
<div id="outline-container-orgff3b778" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgff3b778">If everyone is responsible, then no one is.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgff3b778">
<p>
As I mentioned in <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/04/12/why-do-we-need-managers/">Why Do We Need Managers?</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Let's admit it: not everyone would think about how to improve the way
they work. If everyone knows the value of continuous improvement and
do it, then we don't need managers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-orgfcb02c4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfcb02c4">Only discipline can bring freedom</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfcb02c4">
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>后来才发现自律者才会有自由。</li>
<li>当一个人缺乏自律的时候，他做的事情总是在受习惯和即时诱惑的影响，要么就是被他人的思想观念所扰，几乎永远不可能去做内心真正渴望的事。</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
To translate it into English:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Only disciplined person can have freedom</li>
<li>When a person lacks discipline, everything he/she does would either
be directed by habits or impulses, or be influenced by others' opinions.
Thus he/she can't work on what he/she really wants.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's the same for "flat" v.s. "non-flat" structures. Both of them can
be effective structure as long as we have disciplines to back us
up. It's just easier to lose the discipline in a "flat" environment
because many people understand "flat" as "being undisciplined" which
is not the case.
</p>

<p>
And even if you are being truly "flat" like Valve did, people would
still find restrictions for themselves:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>there is actually a hidden layer of powerful management structure in
the company and it felt a lot like high school. There are popular
kids that have acquired power in the company, then there's the
trouble makers, and everyone in between</li>
<li>According to the interview, it works well for small groups like her
hardware team. The problem as she sees it is one of
scalability. <b>What works for five or 20 people doesn't necessarily
support 300.</b></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-org49fa8a0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org49fa8a0">Being disciplined and flat at the same time</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org49fa8a0">
<p>
So here comes the solution to the problem we have: setting clear goals
and always stretching for more. And I'm trying to adopt <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/05/07/clippings-from-measure-what-matters/">OKRs</a> in my
current company now. In the future, I may write another post to update
how it goes.
