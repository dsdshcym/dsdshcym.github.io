<li>OKRs are a simple process that helps drive varied organizations
forward.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Take it as a blueprint and make it yours, based on what you want
to see happen!</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For leaders, OKRs give a lot of visibility into an
organization.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
They also provide a productive way to push back.

<pre class="example">
Why can't users load a video on YouTube almost instantly? Isn't that
more important than this other goal you're planning to do next
quarter?
</pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li>OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They've helped make our crazily bold mission of “organizing the
world's information” perhaps even achievable.</li>
<li>They've kept me and the rest of the company on time and on track
when it mattered the most.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org012d5b5">
<blockquote>
<p>
If you don't know where you're going, you might not get there.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The founders were quintessential visionaries, with extreme
entrepreneurial energy. What they lacked was management
experience.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For Google to have real impact, or even to reach liftoff, they
would have to learn to make tough choices and keep their team on
track.</li>
<li>Given their healthy appetite for risk, they'd need to pull the
plug on losers—to fail fast.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Ideas are easy. Execution is everything.</i></li>
<li>OKR
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Short for Objectives and Key Results.</li>
<li>It is a collaborative goal-setting protocol for companies, teams,
and individuals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>OKRs are not a silver bullet
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They cannot substitute for sound judgment, strong leadership, or a
creative workplace culture.</li>
<li>But if those fundamentals are in place, OKRs can guide you to the
mountaintop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Definitions (when first introduced to Google)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company
focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the
organization.</li>
<li>An OBJECTIVE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more and no less.</li>
<li>By definition, objectives are <i>significant</i>, <i>concrete</i>, <i>action
oriented</i>, and (ideally) <i>inspirational</i>.</li>
<li>When properly designed and deployed, they're a vaccine against
fuzzy thinking—and fuzzy execution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>KEY RESULTS
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective.</li>
<li>Effective KRs are <i>specific</i> and <i>time-bound</i>, <i>aggressive</i> yet
<i>realistic</i>.</li>
<li><p>
Most of all, they are <i>measurable</i> and <i>verifiable</i>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It's not a key result unless it has a number.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>You either meet a key result's requirements or you don't;</li>
<li>Where an objective can be long-lived, rolled over for a year or
longer, key results evolve as the work progresses.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Once they are all completed, the objective is necessarily
achieved.</li>
<li>And if it isn't, the OKR was poorly designed in the first
place.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use care when applying goals in your organization.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Goals may cause systematic problems in organizations due to
narrowed focus, unethical behavior, increased risk taking,
decreased cooperation, and decreased motivation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For anyone striving for high performance in the workplace, goals are
very necessary things.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Performance
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"hard goals" drive performance more effectively than easy goals.</li>
<li><i>specific</i> hard goals "produce a higher level of output" than
vaguely worded ones.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>how</i> do you build engagement?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>no single factor has more impact than <i>clearly defined goals
that are written down and shared freely.</i></li>
<li>Goals create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Goal setting isn't bulletproof:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When people have conflicting priorities or unclear, meaningless,
or arbitrarily shifting goals, they become frustrated, cynical,
and demotivated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An effective goal management system links goals to a team's broader
mission.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It respects targets and deadlines while adapting to circumstances.</li>
<li>It promotes feedback and celebrates wins, large and small.</li>
<li>Most important, it expands our limits. (It moves us to strive for
what might seem beyond our reach.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>goals "can inspire employees and improve performance."</li>
<li>In today's economy, change is a fact of life.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We cannot cling to what's worked and hope for the best.</li>
<li>We need a trusty scythe to carve a path ahead of the curve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>OKRs are Swiss Army knives, suited to any environment.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At smaller start-ups, where people absolutely need to be pulling
in the same direction, OKRs are a survival tool.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Structured goals give backers a yardstick for success: We're
going to build this product, and we've proven the market by
talking to twenty-five customers, and here's how much they're
willing to pay.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At medium-size, rapidly scaling organizations, OKRs are a shared
language for execution.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They clarify expectations: What do we need to get done (and
fast), and who's working on it?</li>
<li>They keep employees aligned, vertically and horizontally.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In larger enterprises, OKRs are neon-lit road signs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They demolish silos and cultivate connections among far-flung
contributors.</li>
<li>By enabling frontline autonomy, they give rise to fresh
solutions.</li>
<li>And they keep even the most successful organizations stretching
for more.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>objectives and key results drive clarity, accountability, and the
uninhibited pursuit of greatness.</li>
<li>If this book were an OKR, I'd call its objective aspirational: to
make people's lives, your life, more fulfilling.</li>
<li>this book comes in two complementary sections.

superior execution and workplace satisfaction.

<li>or trapped and obscured in silos;</li>

<h4 id="org9a69ecf">Measuring Output</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9a69ecf">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Andy Grove's quantum leap was to <i>apply manufacturing production
principles to the "soft professions"</i>, the administrative,
professional, and managerial ranks.</li>
<li>He sought to
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"create an environment that values and emphasizes output"</li>
<li>avoid what Drucker termed the "activity trap": "[S]tressing output
is the key to increasing productivity, while looking to increase
activity can result in just the opposite."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grove wrestled with two riddles:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How can we define and measure output by knowledge workers?</li>
<li>And what can be done to increase it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At Intel,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Andy recruited "aggressive introverts" in his own image, people
who solved problems quickly, objectively, systematically, and
permanently.</li>
<li>Following his lead, they were skilled at confronting a problem
without attacking the person.</li>
<li>They set politics aside to make faster, sounder, more collective
decisions.</li>
</ul></li>

In nearly every respect, the new method (OKRs) negated the old

For the feedback to be effective, it must be received very soon
after the activity it is measuring occurs. Accordingly, an [OKR]
system should set objectives for a relatively short period. For
example, if we plan on a yearly basis, the corresponding [OKR]
time should be at least as often as quarterly or perhaps even
monthly.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgac749a3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>If you share a goal that nobody sees, is the system truly
transparent?</b></li>
<li>Without frequent status updates, goals slide into irrelevance;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the gap between plan and reality widens by the day.</li>
<li>At quarter's end (or worse, year's end), we're left with zombie
OKRs, on-paper <i>what</i> s and <i>how</i> s devoid of life or meaning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Contributors are most engaged when they can actually see how their
work contributes to the company's success.</li>
<li>OKRs speak to something more powerful, the intrinsic value of the
work itself.</li>
<li>As the bar for structured goal setting rises, more organizations are
adopting robust, dedicated, cloud-based OKR management software.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The best-in-class platforms feature mobile apps, automatic
updating, analytics reporting tools, real-time alerts, and
integration with Salesforce, JIRA, and Zendesk.</li>
<li>These platforms deliver transformative OKR values:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They make everyone's goals more visible.</li>
<li>They drive engagement.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you know you're working on the right things, it's easier
to stay motivated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They promote internal networking.</li>
<li>They save time, money, and frustration.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In conventional goal setting, hours are wasted digging for
documentation in meeting notes, emails, Word documents, and
PowerPoint slides.</li>
<li>With an OKR management platform, all relevant information is
ready when you are.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The upshot, Pence says, was radical transparency, real-time
connection, and a company that coordinated operations as a matter
of course.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge82a2eb">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Research suggests that making measured headway can be more
incentivizing than public recognition, monetary inducements, or even
achieving the goal itself.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>The single greatest motivator is "making progress in one's work"</b></li>
<li>The days that people make progress are the days they feel most
motivated and engaged</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Most goal management platforms use visual aids to show progress
toward objectives and key results.</li>
<li><p>
OKRs don't require daily tracking. But regular check-ins—preferably
weekly—are essential to prevent slippage.
</p>
<pre class="example">
Without an action plan, the executive becomes a prisoner of
events. And without check-ins to reexamine the plan as events unfold,
the executive has no way of knowing which events really matter and
which are only noise
</pre></li>
<li><b>the simple act of writing down a goal increases your chances of
reaching it.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your odds are better still if you monitor progress while sharing the
goal with colleagues</li>
<li>In one California study, people who recorded their goals and sent
weekly progress reports to a friend attained 43 percent more of
their objectives than those who merely thought about goals without
sharing them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As we track and audit our OKRs, we have four options at any point in
the cycle:
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Continue</dt><dd>If a green zone ("on track") goal isn't broken, don't
fix it.</dd>
<dt>Update</dt><dd>Modify a yellow zone ("needs attention") key result or
objective to respond to changes in the workflow or
external environment. What could be done differently to
get the goal on track? Does it need a revised time line?
Do we back-burner other initiatives to free up resources
for this one?</dd>
<dt>Start</dt><dd>Launch a new OKR mid-cycle, whenever the need arises.</dd>
<dt>Stop</dt><dd>When a red zone ("at risk") goal has outlived its
usefulness, the best solution may be to drop it</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>The point of a real-time dashboard is to
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>quantify progress against a target</li>
<li>flag what needs attention
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
While OKRs are primarily a positive force for <i>more</i>, they also
stop us from persisting in the wrong direction.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step
we take just gets us to the wrong place faster
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Late-in-game surprises are less likely when you track your OKRs
for continuous feedback.</li>
<li>Whenever a key result or objective becomes obsolete or
impractical, feel free to end it midstream.</li>
<li>One proviso:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When an objective gets dropped before the end of the OKR
interval, it's important to notify everyone depending on it.</li>

the quarter?</li>
<li>How will I apply this lesson in the future?</li>

<li>For best results, <b>OKRs are scrutinized several times per quarter</b>
by contributors and their managers.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>OKRs do not expire with completion of the work.</li>
<li>As in any data-driven system, tremendous value can be gained from
post hoc evaluation and analysis.</li>
<li>In both one-on-ones and team meetings, these wrap-ups consist of
three parts:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>objective scoring
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In scoring our OKRs, we mark what we've achieved and address
how we might do it differently next time.</li>
<li>A low score forces reassessment:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is the objective still worth pursuing?</li>
<li>If so, what can we change to achieve it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The simplest, cleanest way to score an objective is by
averaging the percentage completion rates of its associated key
results.</li>
<li>Google uses a scale of 0 to 1.0:
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>0.7 to 1.0 = green.</dt><dd>We delivered.</dd>
<dt>0.4 to 0.6 = yellow.</dt><dd>We made progress, but fell short of completion.</dd>
<dt>0.0 to 0.3 = red.</dt><dd>We failed to make real progress.</dd>

<li>subjective self-assessment
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By itself, the data doesn't afford us much insight.</li>
<li>Googlers are encouraged to use their OKRs in
self-assessments—as guides, not as grades.</li>
<li>The point of objectives and key results, after all, is to <b>get
everyone working on the right things.</b></li>
<li>In the end, <b>the numbers are probably less important than
contextual feedback and a broader discussion within the team.</b></li>
<li>There are no judgments, only learnings.</li>

and articulate the key lessons taught by experience</li>
<li><b>We do not learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on
experience.</b> - John Dewey</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Here are some reflections for closing out an OKR cycle:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Did I accomplish all of my objectives? If so, what
contributed to my success?</li>
<li>If not, what obstacles did I encounter?</li>
<li>If I were to rewrite a goal achieved in full, what would I
change?</li>
<li>What have I learned that might alter my approach to the next

</ul></li>
<li>OKR wrap-ups are retrospective and forward-looking at the same
time.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An unfinished objective might be rolled over to the next
quarter, with a fresh set of key results</li>
<li>or perhaps its moment has passed, and it is appropriately
dropped.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3327442">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We need a new HR model for the new world of work.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Annual performance reviews are costly, exhausting, and mostly
futile.</li>
<li><b>individuals cannot be reduced to numbers.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>That transformational system, the contemporary alternative to annual
reviews, is <i>continuous performance management</i></li>
<li>It is implemented with an instrument called CFRs, for:
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Conversations</dt><dd>an authentic, richly textured exchange between
manager and contributor, aimed at driving
performance</dd>
<dt>Feedback</dt><dd>bidirectional or networked communication among peers
to evaluate progress and guide future improvement</dd>
<dt>Recognition</dt><dd>expressions of appreciation to deserving
individuals for contributions of all sizes</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Like OKRs, CFRs champion transparency, accountability, empowerment,
and teamwork, at all levels of the organization.</li>
<li>As communication stimuli, CFRs ignite OKRs and then boost them into
orbit;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>they're a complete delivery system for measuring what matters.</li>
<li>They capture the full richness and power of Andy Grove's
innovative method.</li>
<li>They give OKRs their human voice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Best of all, OKRs and CFRs are mutually reinforcing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You need continuous performance management to surface the critical
questions:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Was the goal harder to achieve than you'd thought when you set
it?</li>
<li>Was it the right goal in the first place?</li>
<li>Is it motivating?</li>
<li>Should we double down on the two or three things that really
worked for us last quarter, or is it time to consider a pivot?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the other hand, if you don't have goals,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>what the heck are you talking about?</li>
<li>What did you achieve, and how?</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge7a68a2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To reap the full benefits of OKRs, feedback must be integral to the
process.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>If you don’t know how well you’re performing, how can you
possibly get better?</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Today’s workers want to be ‘empowered’ and ‘inspired,’ not told what
to do.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They want to provide feedback <i>to</i> their managers, not wait for a
year to receive feedback <i>from</i> their managers.</li>
<li>They want to discuss their goals on a regular basis, share them
with others, and track progress from peers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Public, transparent OKRs will trigger good questions from all
directions:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Are these the right things for me/you/us to be focused on?</li>
<li>If I/you/we complete them, will it be seen as a huge success?</li>
<li>Do you have any feedback on how I/we could stretch even more?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Feedback can be highly constructive—but only if it is <b>specific</b>.</li>
<li><b>Feedback is ad hoc, real-time, and multidirectional, an open
dialogue between people anywhere in the organization.</b></li>
<li>By fostering connections among teams, peer feedback is especially
valuable in cross-functional initiatives.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When horizontal communication blows open, interdepartmental
teamwork becomes the new normal.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc6e2610">
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>Here are some ways to implement it:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Institute peer-to-peer recognition</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When employee achievements are consistently recognized by peers,
a culture of gratitude is born.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>completion of special projects</li>
<li>achievement of company goals</li>
<li>demonstrations of company values</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Replace “Employee of the Month” with “Achievement of the Month.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Share recognition stories</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Newsletters or company blogs can supply the narrative behind the
accomplishment, giving recognition more meaning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Make recognition frequent and attainable</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hail smaller accomplishments, too:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>that extra effort to meet a deadline,</li>
<li>that special polish on a proposal,</li>

<li>the little things a manager might take for granted.</li>

<li>OKR platforms are custom-built for peer-to-peer recognition</li>
<li>Once teams and departments start connecting in this fashion, more

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In all, the company devoted a total of eighty thousand manager
hours—the equivalent of nearly forty full-time hires—to a mechanical
process that created no discernible value.</li>
<li>Lightweight, flexible, and transparent, with minimal structure and
no tracking or paperwork, Check-in features three focus areas:

<li>Regular feedback</li>
<li>Career development and growth</li>

<li>Since the fall of 2012, when Check-in was installed, Adobe's

well, it's also the greatest gift you can give to someone—because it

positive, valuable way.</li>
<li>As Check-in makes clear, HR leaders exist for the success of the
business.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our role is to consult with other leaders on how to make all of

<li>What if a goal-setting platform could pulse two or three
questions to employees whenever they log in?</li>
<li>What if it merged quantitative data on goal progress with

<li>"In the past," Dov told me, "when employees just needed to do the

matter so much. But now we're living in a world where we're asking
people to do <i>the next right thing</i>. A rulebook can tell me what I

<h4 id="orgdb5e210">Classic OKR-Writing Mistakes and Traps</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdb5e210">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Failing to differentiate between committed and aspirational OKRs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Marking a committed OKR as aspirational
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>increases the chance of failure.</li>
<li>Teams may not take it seriously and may not change their other
priorities to focus on delivering the OKR.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Marking an aspirational OKR as committed
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>creates defensiveness in teams who cannot find a way to deliver
the OKR</li>
<li>invites priority inversion as committed OKRs are de-staffed to
focus on the aspirational OKR.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Business-as-usual OKRs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>OKRs are often written principally based on what the team
believes it can achieve without changing anything they're
currently doing,</li>
<li>as opposed to what the team or its customers really want.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Timid aspirational OKRs
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Aspirational OKRs very often start from the current state and
effectively ask, "What could we do if we had extra staff and got
a bit lucky?"
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An alternative and better approach is to start with, "What
could my [or my customers'] world look like in several years if
we were freed from most constraints?"</li>
<li>By definition, you're not going to know how to achieve this
state when the OKR is first formulated—that is why it is an
aspirational OKR.</li>
<li>But without understanding and articulating the desired end
state, you guarantee that you are not going to be able to
achieve it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The litmus test for timid aspirational OKRs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you ask your customers what they really want, does your
aspirational objective meet or exceed their request?
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sandbagging
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A team's committed OKRs should credibly consume most but not all
of their available resources.</li>
<li>Their committed + aspirational OKRs should credibly consume
somewhat more than their available resources. (Otherwise they're
effectively commits.)</li>
<li>Teams who can meet all of their OKRs without needing all of their
team's headcount/capital . . . are assumed to either be hoarding
resources or not pushing their teams, or both. This is a cue for
senior management to reassign headcount and other resources to
groups who will make more effective use of them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Low Value Objectives (aka the "Who cares" OKR)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>OKRs must promise clear business value—otherwise, there's no
reason to expend resources doing them.</li>
<li><p>
Low Value Objectives (LVOs) are those for which, even if the
Objective is completed with a 1.0, no one will notice or care.
</p>
<pre class="example">
LVO: Increase task CPU utilization by 3 percent.

Better: Decrease quantity of cores required to serve peak queries by 3
percent with no change to quality/latency/ . . . and return resulting
excess cores to the free pool
</pre></li>
<li><p>
The litmus test for LVO:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Could the OKR get a 1.0 under reasonable circumstances without
providing direct end-user or economic benefit?
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
If so, then reword the OKR to focus on the tangible benefit.
</p>
<pre class="example">
LVO: Launch X

Better: Double fleet-wide Y by launching X to 90+ percent of borg
cells
</pre></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Insufficient KRs for committed Os
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>OKRs are divided into
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>the objective</dt><dd>The desired outcome</dd>
<dt>the key results</dt><dd>The measurable steps required to achieve that outcome</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>It is critical that KRs are written such that scoring 1.0 on all
key results generates a 1.0 score for the objective</li>
<li>A common error is writing key results that are <i>necessary but not
sufficient</i> to collectively complete the objective
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The error is tempting because it allows a team to avoid the
difficult (resource/priority/risk) commitments needed to
deliver "hard" key results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This trap is particularly pernicious because it delays both the
discovery of the resource requirements for the objective, and the
discovery that the objective will not be completed on schedule.</li>
<li><p>
The litmus test for Insufficient KRs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is it reasonably possible to score 1.0 on all the key results but
still not achieve the intent of the objective?
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If so, add or rework the key results until their successful
completion guarantees that the objective is also successfully
completed.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4443356">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For committed OKRs
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Teams are expected to rearrange their other priorities to ensure
an on-schedule 1.0 delivery.</li>
<li>Teams who cannot credibly promise to deliver a 1.0 on a committed
OKR must escalate promptly.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Escalating in this (common) situation is not only OK, it is
required.</li>
<li><b>It allows the team's management to develop options and resolve
conflicts.</b></li>
<li>The corollary is that every new OKR is likely to involve some
amount of escalation,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>since it requires a change to existing priorities and
commitments.</li>
<li>An OKR that requires no changes to any group's activities is a
business-as-usual OKR</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A committed OKR that fails to achieve a 1.0 by its due date
requires a postmortem.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is not intended to punish teams.</li>
<li>It is intended to understand what occurred in the planning
and/or execution of the OKR, so that teams may improve their
ability to reliably hit 1.0 on committed OKRs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>ensuring that a service meets its SLA (service level
agreement) for the quarter;</li>
<li>delivering a defined feature or improvement to an
infrastructure system by a set date;</li>
<li>manufacturing and delivering a quantity of servers at a cost
point.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>For aspirational OKRs
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The OKRs' priority should inform team members' decisions on where
to spend the remaining time they have after the group's
commitments are met.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In general, higher priority OKRs should be completed before
lower priority OKRs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aspirational OKRs and their associated priorities should remain on
a team's OKR list until they are completed, carrying them forward
from quarter to quarter as necessary
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dropping them from the OKR list because of lack of progress is a
mistake, as it disguises persistent problems of prioritization,
resource availability, or a lack of understanding of the
problem/solution.</li>
<li>Corollary: It is good to move an aspirational OKR to a different
team's list if that team has both the expertise and bandwidth to
accomplish the OKR more effectively than the current OKR owner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Team managers are expected to assess the resources required to
accomplish their aspirational OKRs and <i>ask for them</i> each
quarter, fulfilling their duty to express known demand to the
business.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Managers should not expect to receive all the required
resources, however, unless their aspirational OKRs are the
highest priority goals in the company after the committed OKRs.</li>

<li>If the contributor is underperforming, how should he or she
course-correct?</li>
<li>If the contributor is performing well or exceeding
expectations, what can I do to sustain a high level of
performance without burnout?</li>
<li>When is the contributor most engaged?</li>
<li>When is the contributor least engaged?</li>
<li>What strengths does the contributor bring to the work?</li>
<li>What types of learning experience might benefit this
contributor?</li>
<li>Over the next six months, what should the contributor’s
focus be? Meeting expectations in his or her current role?
Maximizing contributions in the current role? Or preparing
for the next opportunity—be it a new project, expanded
responsibility, or new role?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Contributors, too, should prepare for performance
conversations. Specifically, they can ask themselves:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Am I on track to meet my objectives?</li>
<li>Have I identified areas of opportunity?</li>
<li>Do I understand how my work connects to broader milestones?</li>
<li>What feedback can I give my manager?</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org760be8c">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Four Superpowers of OKRs
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Focus and Commit to Priorities
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Set the appropriate cadence for your OKR cycle.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I recommend dual tracking,
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>quarterly OKRs (for shorter-term goals)</li>
<li>annual OKRs (keyed to longer-term strategies)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>deployed in parallel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To work out implementation kinks and strengthen leaders’
commitment, <b>phase in your rollout of OKRs with upper
management first.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Allow the process to gain momentum before enlisting
individual contributors to join in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Designate an OKR shepherd to make sure that every individual
devotes the time each cycle to choosing what matters most.</li>
<li><b>Commit to three to five top objectives— <i>what</i> you need to
achieve—per cycle.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Too many OKRs dilute and scatter people’s efforts.</li>
<li>Expand your effective capacity by deciding what <i>not</i> to do,
and discard, defer, or deemphasize accordingly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In choosing OKRs, look for objectives with the most leverage
for outstanding performance.</li>
<li>Find the raw material for top-line OKRs in the organization’s
mission statement, strategic plan, or a broad theme chosen by
leadership.</li>
<li>To emphasize a departmental objective and enlist lateral
support, elevate it to a company OKR.</li>
<li>For each objective, settle on no more than five measurable,
unambiguous, time-bound key results— <i>how</i> the objective will
be attained.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By definition, completion of all key results equates to the
attainment of the objective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For balance and quality control, pair qualitative and
quantitative key results.</li>
<li>When a key result requires extra attention, elevate it into an
objective for one or more cycles.</li>
<li><b>The single most important element for OKR success is
conviction and buy-in by the organization’s leaders.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Align and Connect for Teamwork
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Incentivize employees by showing how their objectives relate to
the leader’s vision and the company’s top priorities. The
express route to operating excellence is lined with
transparent, public goals, on up to the CEO.</li>
<li>Use all-hands meetings to explain why an OKR is important to
the organization. Then keep repeating the message until you’re
tired of hearing it yourself.</li>
<li>When deploying cascaded OKRs, with objectives driven from the
top, welcome give-and-take on key results from frontline
contributors. Innovation dwells less at a company’s center than
at its edges.</li>
<li>Encourage a healthy proportion of bottom-up OKRs—roughly half.</li>
<li>Smash departmental silos by connecting teams with horizontally
shared OKRs. Cross-functional operations enable quick and
coordinated decisions, the basis for seizing a competitive
advantage.</li>
<li>Make all lateral, cross-functional dependencies explicit.</li>
<li>When an OKR is revised or dropped, see to it that all
stakeholders know about it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Track for Accountability
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To build a culture of accountability, install continuous
reassessment and honest and objective grading—and start at the
top. When leaders openly admit their missteps, contributors
feel freer to take healthy risks.</li>
<li>Motivate contributors less with extrinsic rewards and more with
open, tangible measures of their achievement.</li>
<li>To keep OKRs timely and relevant, have the designated shepherd
ride herd over regular check-ins and progress updates. Frequent
check-ins enable teams and individuals to course-correct with
agility, or to fail fast.</li>
<li>To sustain high performance, encourage weekly one-on-one OKR
meetings between contributors and managers, plus monthly
departmental meetings.</li>
<li>As conditions change, feel free to revise, add, or delete OKRs
as appropriate—even in mid-cycle. Goals are not written in
stone. It’s counterproductive to hold stubbornly to objectives
that are no longer relevant or attainable.</li>
<li>At the cycle’s end, use OKR grades plus subjective
self-assessments to evaluate past performance, celebrate
achievements, and plan and improve for the future. Before
pushing into the next cycle, take a moment to reflect upon and
savor what you’ve accomplished in the last one.</li>
<li>To keep OKRs up-to-date and on point, invest in a dedicated,
automated, cloud-based platform. Public, collaborative,
real-time goal-setting systems work best.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stretch for Amazing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At the beginning of each cycle, distinguish between goals that
must be attained 100 percent (committed OKRs) and those that
are stretching for a Big Hairy Audacious Goal (a BHAG, or
aspirational OKR).</li>
<li>Establish an environment where individuals are free to fail
without judgment.</li>
<li>To stimulate problem solving and spur people to greater
achievement, set ambitious goals—even if it means some
quarterly targets will be missed. But don’t set the bar so high
that an OKR is obviously unrealistic. Morale suffers when
people know they can’t succeed.</li>
<li>To get leaps in productivity or innovation, follow Google’s
“Gospel of 10x” and replace incremental OKRs with exponential
ones. That’s how industries get disrupted and categories
reinvented.</li>
<li>Design stretch OKRs to fit the organization’s culture. A
company’s optimal “stretch” may vary over time, depending on
the operating needs of the coming cycle.</li>
<li>When a team fails to attain a stretch OKR, consider rolling the
objective over to the next cycle—assuming the goal is still
relevant.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Continuous Performance Management
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To address issues before they become problems and give struggling
contributors the support they need, move from annual performance
management to continuous performance management.</li>
<li>Unleash ambitious goal setting by divorcing forward-looking OKRs
from backward-looking annual reviews. Equating goal attainment to
bonus checks will invite sandbagging and risk-averse behavior.</li>
<li>Replace competitive ratings and stack rankings with transparent,
strength-based, multidimensional criteria for performance
evaluations. Beyond the numbers, consider a contributor’s team
play, communication, and ambition in goal setting.</li>
<li>Rely on intrinsic motivations—purposeful work and opportunities
for growth—over financial incentives. They’re far more powerful.</li>
<li>To power positive business results, implement ongoing CFRs
(conversations, feedback, and recognition) in concert with
structured goal setting. Transparent OKRs make coaching more
concrete and useful. Continuous CFRs keep day-to-day work on point
and genuinely collaborative.</li>
<li>In performance-driving conversations between managers and
contributors, allow the contributor to set the agenda. The
manager’s role is to learn and coach.</li>
<li>Make performance feedback two-way, ad hoc, and multidirectional,
unconstrained by the org chart.</li>
<li>Use anonymous “pulse” surveys for real-time feedback on particular
operations or general morale.</li>
<li>Strengthen connections between teams and departments with
peer-to-peer feedback, in conjunction with cross-functional OKRs.</li>
<li>Employ peer recognition to enhance employee engagement and
performance. For maximum impact, recognition should be frequent,
specific, highly visible, and tied to top-line OKRs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Importance of Culture
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Align top-line OKRs with an organization’s mission, vision, and
North Star values.</li>
<li>Convey cultural values by word, but most of all by deed.</li>
<li>Promote peak performance with collaboration and
accountability. When OKRs are collective, assign key results to
individuals—and hold them accountable.</li>
<li>To develop a high-motivation culture, balance OKR “catalysts,”
actions that support the work, with CFR “nourishers,” acts of
interpersonal support or even random acts of kindness.</li>
<li>Use OKRs to promote transparency, clarity, purpose, and
big-picture orientation. Deploy CFRs to build positivity,
enthusiasm, stretch thinking, and daily improvement.</li>
<li>Be alert to the need to address cultural barriers, especially
issues of accountability and trust, before implementing OKRs.</li>
