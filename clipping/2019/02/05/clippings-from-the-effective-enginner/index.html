<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb068f80">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Work smarter, not harder</li>
<li><b>Working more hours isn't the most effective way to increase output</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Working too many hours leads to decreased productivity and
burnout.</li>
<li>Output may even turn out to be negative when it's necessary to
repair the mistakes made by overworked and fatigued engineers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To be effective engineers, we need to be able to <b>identify which
activities produce more impact with smaller time investments</b>.</li>
<li>What Makes an Effective Engineer?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This book examines and describes what it means to be an effective
engineer, and it distills the key lessons that I’ve learned. From
author's experience of:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>worked as a software engineer at many technology companies,
including Microsoft, Google, Ooyala, Quora, and Quip.</li>
<li>participated in various aspects of growing an engineering team.</li>
<li>created onboarding and mentoring programs and have trained
dozens of new engineering hires</li>
<li>shelves of productivity, team-building, personal psychology,
business, and self-help books.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What makes an effective engineer?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Produce results</li>
<li>Get things done efficiently</li>
<li>Know how to choose <i>which</i> results to deliver (<b>Focus on value
and impact</b>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>An effective engineer, therefore, is defined by <b>the rate at which
he or she produces value per unit of time worked</b> (<b>Leverage</b>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What You'll Learn from Reading This Book
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Technical knowledge, however, represents only a fraction of the
skills that engineers need to learn in order to be effective.</li>
<li>More important for effectiveness, but often overlooked by
engineers, are the <b>meta-skills</b>.</li>
<li><b>The Effective Engineer teaches you these meta-skills.</b></li>
<li>A useful framework, called <b>leverage</b>, for analyzing the
effectiveness of different activities.

<li>Quora's Onboarding/Mentoring Program
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mentoring program
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each new engineer was paired up with a mentor for two to three
months, and the mentor was responsible for the new hire's
success.</li>
<li>Mentoring activities included:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>reviewing code</li>
<li>outlining technical skills to learn</li>
<li>and pair programming</li>
<li>discussing engineering tradeoffs</li>
<li>explaining how to prioritize better</li>
<li>offering guidance on how to work well with different team members.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mentors also planned a sequence of starter tasks and projects to
increase the new hires' mastery of our systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Onboarding program
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a series of 10 recurring tech talks</li>
<li>10 codelabs, documents that:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>explained why we designed core abstractions</li>
<li>described how to use them</li>
<li>walked through the relevant code</li>
<li>provided exercises to validate understanding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Through tech talks and codelabs, we gave our hires an overview
of the codebase and the engineering focus areas, and taught them
how to use our development and debugging tools.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use Leverage as Your Yardstick for Effectiveness
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The key to prioritizing different activities is assessing their
<i>leverage</i></li>
<li>Definition
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Leverage</i> is defined by a simple equation: the impact produced
per time invested \((Impact Produced)/(Time Invested)\)</li>
<li><i>Leverage</i> is the return on investment (ROI) for the effort that's
put in</li>
<li>Effective engineers try to increase the numerator (impact
produced) in that equation while keeping  the denominator (time
invested) small</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Leverage is critical because <b>time is your most limited
resource</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unlike other resources, time cannot be stored, extended, or
replaced</li>
<li>There's more work to be done than time available, and you'll
need to start <b>prioritizing</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>80/20 principle / Pareto principle
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That 20% comprises the high-leverage activities</li>
<li>Effective engineers use this simple equation as their central,
guiding metric for determining how and where to spend their
time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>that 1% time investment can have an outsized influence on the
productivity and effectiveness of the other 99% of work hours.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mentoring is a prime example of a high-ROI activity.</li>
<li>Pointing out a useful UNIX command could save minutes or hours
on basic tasks.</li>
<li>Walking through debugging tools could drastically reduce
development time for every new feature.</li>
<li>Reviewing code early and thoroughly to catch common errors could
remove the need to re-address similar issues later and prevent
bad habits from forming.</li>
<li>Teaching a new hire how to prioritize different projects to
complete or skills to learn could easily increase his
productivity.</li>
<li>Planning good starter projects that teach core abstractions and
fundamental concepts could improve her software designs and
reduce future maintenance requirements.</li>
<li>Since <b>the success of our startup depended more on the success
of the entire team</b> than on what any one engineer could
accomplish, investing in programs to ramp up new engineers as
quickly and as seamlessly as possible was one of the
highest-leverage activities that we could have done.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increase Your Leverage in Three Ways
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High Output Management: your overall leverage can only be
increased in three ways:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity</li>
<li>By increasing the output of a particular activity</li>
<li>By shifting to higher-leverage activities</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Translated into three questions we can ask ourselves about any
activity we're working on:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>How can I complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?</li>
<li>How can I increase the value produced by this activity?</li>
<li>Is there something else that I could spend my time on that
would produce more value?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>For example,
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>to increase the meeting's leverage:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Defaulting to a half-hour meeting instead of a one-hour meeting
to get the same amount done in less time</li>
<li>Preparing an agenda and a set of goals for the meeting and
circulating them to attendees beforehand so that the meeting is
focused and more productive.</li>
<li>If an in-person discussion isn't actually necessary, replacing
the meeting with a email discussion and spending the time
building an important feature instead.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>to increase the leverage of your development time:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Automating parts of the development or testing process that
have thus far been done manually, so that you can iterate
more quickly.</li>
<li>Prioritizing tasks based on how critical they are for launch
so that you maximize the value of what you finally ship.</li>
<li>Talking with the customer support team to gain insights into
the customers' biggest pain points, and using that knowledge
to understand whether there's another feature you could be
working on that would produce even more value with less
development effort.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>to increase the leverage for performance engineering
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Learning to effectively use a profiling tool so that you can
reduce the time it takes to identify each bottleneck.</li>
<li>Measuring both the performance and visit frequency of each
web page so that you can address the bottlenecks that affect
the most traffic first, thereby increasing the impact of
each fix you make.</li>
<li>Working with product teams to design performant software
from the outset, so that application speed is prioritized as
a feature during product development rather than treated as
a bug to be fixed.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Direct Energy Toward Leverage Points, Not Just Easy Wins
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As you make your way through this book, constantly keep one lesson
in mind: focus on high-leverage activities</li>
<li><b>Don't confuse high-leverage activities with easy wins</b></li>
<li>Leverage is used not just by effective engineers, but also by the
world's most successful people.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Key Takeaways
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Use leverage to measure your engineering effectiveness.</dt><dd>Focus on what generates the highest return on investment for your time spent.</dd>
<dt>Systematically increase the leverage of your time.</dt><dd>Find ways to get an activity done more quickly, to increase the
impact of an activity, or to shift to activities with higher
leverage.</dd>
<dt>Focus your effort on leverage points.</dt><dd>Time is your most limited asset. Identify the habits that
produce disproportionately high impact for the time you invest.</dd>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Three lessons from compound interest
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Compounding leads to an exponential growth curve</li>
<li>The earlier compounding starts, the sooner you hit the region of
rapid growth and the faster you can reap its benefits</li>
<li>Even small deltas in the interest rate can make massive
difference in the long run</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Learning, like interest, also compounds
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Learning follows an exponential growth curve
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Knowledge gives you a foundation, enabling you to gain more
knowledge even faster</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The earlier that you optimize for learning, the more time your
learning has to compound</li>
<li>Due to compounding, even small deltas in your own learning rate
make a big difference over the long run</li>
</ol></li>
<li>We tend to drastically underestimate the impact of small changes on
our growth rate</li>
<li>How do we avoid complacency and instead shift ourselves toward a
growth mindset?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Treat yourself like a startup <i>The Startup of You</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Startups initially prioritize learning over profitability to
increase their chances of success</li>
<li>Setting yourself up for long-term success requires thinking of
yourself as a startup or product in beta, a work-in-progress

<li>10 suggestions to take advantage of the resources available to you
at work
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Study code for core abstractions written by the best engineers at
your company.</li>
<li>Write more code.</li>
<li>Go through any technical, educational material available
internally.</li>
<li>Master the programming languages that you use.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make sure that at least one of your languages is a scripting
language (e.g., Python or Ruby) that you can use as your Swiss
army knife for quick tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Send your code reviews to the harshest critics.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Optimize for getting good, thoughtful feedback rather than for
lowering the barrier to getting your work checked in.</li>
<li>Discuss software designs with your company’s best designers in
order to avoid writing great code for a design that doesn’t
work well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enroll in classes on areas where you want to improve.</li>
<li>Participate in design discussions of projects you’re interested
in.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don’t wait for an invitation.</li>
<li>Ask project leads if they’d mind you being a silent observer or
even a participant in a design meeting.</li>
<li>If mailing lists are open internally, add yourself or read
through key conversations in the archives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Work on a diversity of projects.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Interleaving different projects can teach you what problems are
common across projects and what might just be artifacts of your
current one.</li>
<li>The interleaved practice of different skills is more effective
than repeated, massed practice of a single skill at preparing
people to tackle unfamiliar problems</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make sure you’re on a team with at least a few senior engineers
whom you can learn from.</li>
<li>Jump fearlessly into code you don’t know.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>engineering success was highly correlated with “having no
fear in jumping into code they didn’t know.”</b></li>
<li>Fear of failure often holds us back, causing us to give up
before we even try.</li>

<li>"planning creates a link between the situation or cue (the if) and

<li>When the cue triggers, the then behavior "follows <i>automatically</i>

<li>Procrastination primarily stems from a reluctance to expend the
initial activation energy on a task.</li>
<li>This reluctance leads us to rationalize why it might be better

leverage.</li>
<li>When we're in the moment, the short-term value that we get from

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The knowledge of useful numbers provides a valuable shortcut for
knowing where to invest effort to maximize gains</li>
<li><b>Ensuring you have access to a few useful numbers to approximate
your progress and benchmark your performance</b> is a high-leverage
investment: they provide the benefits of metrics at a much lower

performance properties of a design without actually having to
build it.</li>
<li>Internalizing useful numbers can also help you spot anomalies in
data measurements.</li>
<li>Knowledge of useful numbers can clarify both the areas and scope
for improvement.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How to get these numbers:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To obtain performance-related numbers, you can write small
benchmarks to gather data you need.</li>
<li>Other numbers may require more research, like talking with teams

<li>Other times, we confuse correlation with causality.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Our best defense is <b>skepticism</b>

</ul></li>
<li>Untrustworthy data that gets incorporated into decision-making

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unfortunately, it’s all too common for engineers to underinvest in
data integrity, for a few reasons:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Since engineers often work against tight deadlines, metrics—whose
importance only shows up after launch—can get deprioritized.</li>
<li>When building a new product or feature, it’s much easier to test
and validate their interactions than to verify whether some
seemingly plausible metric (like page views) is actually
accurate.</li>
<li>Engineers reason that because their metrics-related code was well
unit-tested, the metrics themselves also should be accurate, even
though there could be system-level errors or incorrect
assumptions.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The net result is that metrics-related code tends to be less
robust than code for other features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Given the importance of metrics, investing the effort to ensure that
your data is accurate is high-leverage.</li>
<li>Some strategies that you can use to increase confidence in your data
integrity:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Log data liberally, in case it turns out to be useful later on.</li>
<li>Build tools to iterate on data accuracy sooner.</li>
<li>Write end-to-end integration tests to validate your entire
analytics pipeline.</li>
<li>Examine collected data sooner.</li>

<li>Because we tend to be familiar with the original version, we
typically underestimate rewrite projects more drastically than we
would an undertaking in a new area.</li>
<li>It is easy and tempting to bundle additional improvements into a
rewrite.</li>
<li>When a rewrite is ongoing, any new features or improvements must
either be added to the rewritten version or they must be
duplicated across the existing version and the new version. The
cost of either option grows with the timeline of the project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 5. The Second-System Effect</li>

<li>The secret to your own career success is to "focus primarily on
making everyone around you succeed</li>
<li>Your career success depends largely on your company and team'a
success, and the success of your company or team depends on more
than just your individual contributiobs</li>
<li>You'll accomplish much more if those around you are aligned with you
rather than against you, and you can do that by investing in their
success</li>

<h4 id="org5dfd91a">Make Hiring Everyone's Responsibility</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5dfd91a">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hiring is an extremely high-leverage activity.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The smaller the company—and the more likely that the person you
interview will be an immediate co-worker—the greater the leverage
of those interviews.</li>
<li>If those 40 hours resulted in even just one additional hire, the
2,000+ hours of output that he or she would contribute per year
would more than justify the cost.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do we design an effective interview process?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A good interview process achieves two goals
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It screens for the type of people likely to do well on the team</li>
<li>It gets candidates excited about the team, the mission, and the
culture
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ideally, even if a candidate goes home without an offer, they
still leave with a good impression of the team and refer
their friends to interview with the company</li>
<li>One of your primary levers as an interviewer is therefore
making the interview experience both fun and rigorous</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>As an interviewer, your goal is to optimize for questions with
high <i>signal-to-noise</i> ratios
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Questions that reveal a large amount of useful information
(signal) about the candidate per minute spent, with little
irrelevant or useless data (noise)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good, well-executed questions let you confidently
differentiate among candidates of varying abilities;</li>
<li>Bad, poorly managed questions leave you unsure whether to hire
the candidate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The types of questions that generate the most signal depend on
<b>the qualities most correlated with success on your team.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An increasing number of companies have shifted toward
interviews that include <b>a hands-on programming component</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ample literature exists to help you get started on designing
questions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Cracking the Code Interview</i></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>How to continuously iterate on improving your interview process.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take time with your team to identify which qualities in a
potential teammate you care about the most</li>
<li>Periodically meet to discuss how effective the current recruiting
and interview processes are at finding new hires who succeed on
the team.</li>
<li>Design interview problems with multiple layers of difficulty that
you can tailor to the candidate's ability by adding or removing
variables and constraints</li>
<li>Control the interview pace to maintain a high signal-to-noise
ratio.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't let interviewees ramble, get stumped, or get sidetracked
for too long.</li>
<li>Either guide the interviewee along with hints, or wrap up and
move on to a different question.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Scan for red flags by rapidly firing short-answer questions to
probe a wide surface area.</li>
<li>Periodically shadow or pair with another team member during
interviews</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to use unconventional interview approaches if they
help you identify the signals that your team cares about.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's worth the effort: the additional output from adding a strong
engineer to your team far exceeds the output of many other
investments that you could make.</li>

<h4 id="orgc8af716">Design a Good Onboarding Process</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc8af716">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As the team grows and the surface area of new things to explore
increases, it becomes harder and harder for a recent hire to figure
out what to learn first without any guidance.</li>
<li>A quality onboarding process is a powerful leverage point for
increasing team effectiveness
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First impressions matter</li>
<li>Training a new engineer for an hour or two a day during her first
month <b>generates much more organizational impact</b> than spending
those same hours working on the product.</li>
<li>The initial time investment to create onboarding resources
continues to pay dividends with each additional team member.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Why?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Investing in your team's success means that you are more likely to
succeed as well.</li>
<li>Effectively ramping up new team members ultimately gives you more
flexibility to choose higher-leverage activities.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A stronger and larger team means
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>easier code reviews</li>
<li>more people available to fix bugs</li>
<li>increased resources for on-call rotations and support</li>
<li>greater opportunities to tackle more ambitious projects.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Onboarding is a win-win situation;
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the new hires receive valuable training,</li>
<li>the mentors get more things done.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A poor onboarding experience reduces a team's effectiveness.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Productive output gets lost when a recent hire takes longer to
ramp up.</li>
<li>Code quality suffers if new team members use abstractions or
tools incorrectly, or if they aren't familiar with team
conventions or expectations.</li>
<li>Insufficient training means it's harder to accurately identify
low performers</li>
<li>Good engineers undergo unnecessary stress and may even get
weeded out because of weak guidance.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Identify the goals that your team wants to achieve

Goals for Quora's onboarding program
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ramp up new engineers as quickly as possible</li>
<li>Impart the team's culture and values</li>
<li>Expose new engineers to the breadth of fundamentals needed to
succeed
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A key part of a good onboarding program is ensuring that
<b>everyone starts on a consistent, solid foundation.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Socially integrate new engineers onto the team</li>
</ol>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Your own goals may vary</li>
<li>What's important is understanding what you want to achieve so
that you can focus your efforts appropriately</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Construct a set of mechanisms to accomplish these goals
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Four main pillars for Quora's onboarding program
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Codelabs
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A codelab is a document that explains why a core
abstraction was designed and how it's used, walks through
relevant parts of its code internals, and supplies
programming exercises to validate understanding.</li>
<li>The codelabs clarified what abstractions were important to
master early on and recommended a particular order for
learning them.</li>
<li>They enabled new engineers to ramp up more quickly and
make product changes sooner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Onboarding talks
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cover the things we believed were the most important for
new hires to learn.</li>
<li>Together, the onboarding talks and codelabs helped ensure
that new hires learned the fundamentals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mentorship
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mentors checked in daily with their mentees during the
first week, and then met for weekly 1:1s.</li>
<li>All of this helped establish the shared goal of ramping up
new hires as quickly as possible, and set the expectation
that they shouldn’t hesitate to seek guidance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Starter tasks
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Complete a starter task by the end of the first week</li>
<li>This aggressive target conveyed the value of getting
things done and moving fast.</li>
<li>It also meant that the team needed to remove enough
onboarding friction for new hires to build momentum
quickly.</li>
<li>Mentors were responsible for identifying starter tasks of
increasing complexity for their mentees.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Building a good onboarding program is an iterative process.</li>
<li>To get a sense of what worked well and what could use some
improvement.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Think about your own experience</li>
<li>Survey others on the team</li>
</ul></li>

<div id="outline-container-orgee35598" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgee35598">Share Ownership of Code</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgee35598">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There’s a common misconception that being the sole engineer
responsible for a project increases your value.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you’re the bottleneck for a project, you lose your
flexibility to work on other things.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>From a company’s perspective, sharing ownership increases the bus factor to more than one.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Shared ownership also means that everyone participates in
maintenance duties and one person doesn’t carry the entire burden.</li>
<li>Shared ownership eliminates isolated silos of information and
enables an engineer to step in for another teammate, so that
everyone can focus on whatever produces the most impact.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This gives senior engineers more free time to work on other
projects and junior engineers an opportunity to ramp up on the
infrastructure and the codebase.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To increase shared ownership, reduce the friction that other team
members might encounter while browsing, understanding, and
modifying code that you write or tools that you build.</li>
<li>Some strategies
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Avoid one-person teams.</li>
<li>Review each other’s code and software designs.</li>
<li>Rotate different types of tasks and responsibilities across the
team.</li>
<li>Keep code readable and code quality high.</li>
<li>Present tech talks on software decisions and architecture.</li>
<li>Document your software, either through high-level design
documents or in code-level comments.</li>
<li>Document the complex workflows or non-obvious workarounds
necessary for you to get things done.</li>
<li>Invest time in teaching and mentoring other team members.</li>

<h4 id="orgbbdd3b6">Build Collective Wisdom through Post-Mortems</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbbdd3b6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Write down
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What happened</li>
<li>How it happened</li>
<li>Why it happened</li>
<li>What we can do to prevent it from happening in the future</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Dedicate the same healthy retrospection to projects and launches
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>How effectively did your feature actually accomplish your team’s
goals?</li>
<li>Was that actually the best use of your team’s time?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Some friction to doing this better
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If your team hasn’t defined a clear goal or metric for a launch,
it’s difficult to assess its success.</li>
<li>If your team doesn’t want to publicly declare months of work to
be a failure, it’s tempting to close discussions.</li>
<li>If your team is overwhelmed with new projects, it’s hard to make
time for reflection.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The goal is not to levy blame but to maximize collective wisdom.</li>
<li>Use methodologies like "Five Whys" to understand the root cause of
operational issues</li>
<li>Holding an honest conversation about a project can be uncomfortable.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It requires acknowledging that months of effort may have resulted
in failure, and viewing the failure as an opportunity for growth.</li>
<li>It requires aligning behind a common goal of improving the
product or team, and not focusing on where to assign blame.</li>
<li>It requires being open and receptive to feedback, with the goal
of building collective wisdom around what went wrong and what
could’ve been done better</li>
