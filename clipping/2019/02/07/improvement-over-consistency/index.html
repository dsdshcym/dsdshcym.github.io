            <h1>Improvement Over Consistency</h1>
            <blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rebuild/rewrite can't fix the real problem - which is <i>the
organizational incentives that put you in that place originally</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hauling everything away and cleaning up the house doesn't fix
people's habits that led to the hoarding.</li>
<li>If you don't change the habits and incentives that led you to that
point, you'll end up with a tangled mess of services mirroring
your tangled mess of monolith code.</li>
<li>And at that point, all you've accomplished with the money &amp; time
they gave you for the rebuild is to shift your problems to the
network layer, where they are way harder to see, analyze, test,
and fix.</li>
<li>That is not progress. IMO that's engineer malpractice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A much more successful treatment for hoarding is to <b>work
intensively one on one with folks</b>,
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>changing their habits slowly over time,</li>
<li>having THEM clean up the house - one little area at a time.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This is where <i>communication skills</i> come into play.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because it is not at all trivial to even <span class="underline">understand</span> the
incentive structure that got you where you are, let alone to
negotiate a new, healthier set of incentives.</li>
<li>Pathology in the hoarded codebases
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>developers don't feel they have time and/or permission to
refactor code.</li>
<li>developers see “refactoring” as a completely separate activity
from building features or fixing bugs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A key indicator of this pathology is seeing stories in the
backlog like “refactor user class.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Improvement Over Consistency
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you had good code, then sure, that (consistency is key to
good code.) would be true. But right now you don't.</li>
<li>One book on the shelf and five in the pile is better than six
books in the pile.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To actually fix it, you need to
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>negotiate with the individuals who are applying the pressure.</li>
<li>understand THEIR incentives,</li>
<li>align your desired changes with those.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You don't want begrudging acceptance. You want enthusiastic
buy-in.</li>
<li>As you improve your communication skills (by doing it badly at
first), you start to get a sense of what works for different
people.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What's limiting your ability to write good code.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is NOT:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>knowledge of the latest framework</li>
<li>how fast your tests run</li>
<li>your own weak moral fiber</li>
<li>your manager, PM, or CEO</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It IS:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how well you understand &amp; work with people</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

-- from <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1090860150712221698">Sarah Mei on Twitter: "I talk a lot about how you can't be a
   great developer without great communication skills, but I don't
   think people grok how <span class="underline">directly</span> your communication skills are
   reflected in your codebase. Let me give you an example."</a>
</p>

<p>
It uses the same idea of hoarding from <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2018/06/07/livable_and_disposable_code/">Livable and Disposable Code</a>,
and says if we want to have good code, we need to value improvement
over consistency.
</p>

<p>
A similar idea was also explained in <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/refactoring-not-on-the-backlog/">Refactoring -- Not on the
backlog!</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A big refactoring session is hard to sell, and if sold, it returns
less than we hoped, after a long delay.
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Hard to sell</dt><dd>We are tempted to ask for time from our product
owner to refactor. Often, that time is not
granted: <b>we're asking for time to fix what we
screwed up in the past.</b></dd>
<dt>Returns less than we hoped</dt><dd>We'll clean up what we see, as well as we can in the time
available, which will never be enough.</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>What should we do?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We take the next feature that we are asked to build, and instead
of detouring around all the weeds and bushes, we take the time to
clear a path through some of them.</li>
<li><b>We improve the code where we work, and ignore the code where we
don't have to work.</b></li>
<li>We get a nice clean path for some of our work. Odds are, <b>we'll
visit this place again</b>: that's how software development works.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Soon, often within the same Sprint where we begin to clean up,
we find that a subsequent feature actually uses an area we just
previously cleaned.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We invest a little time more than we would if we continued to
trash the field, but not much more -- and often less.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
