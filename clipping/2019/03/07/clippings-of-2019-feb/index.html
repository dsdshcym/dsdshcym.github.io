<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We assume that failure is a more likely outcome than success,
and, as a result, we wrongly treat successful outcomes as flukes
and bad results as irrefutable proof that change is difficult.</li>
<li>Only "about one in ten admit to having been involved in a
transformation that was 'completely' or 'mostly' unsuccessful."</li>
<li><b>Adaptation is the rule of human existence, not the exception.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1090860150712221698">Sarah Mei on Twitter: "I talk a lot about how you can't be a great
developer without great communication skills, but I don't think
people grok how <span class="underline">directly</span> your communication skills are reflected
in your codebase. Let me give you an example."</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI77oMKr5EY">RailsConf 2018: Keynote - Livable Code by Sarah Mei - YouTube</a></li>
<li>Rebuild/rewrite can't fix the real problem - which is <i>the
organizational incentives that put you in that place originally</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hauling everything away and cleaning up the house doesn't fix
people's habits that led to the hoarding.</li>
<li>If you don't change the habits and incentives that led you to that
point, you'll end up with a tangled mess of services mirroring
your tangled mess of monolith code.</li>
<li>And at that point, all you've accomplished with the money &amp; time
they gave you for the rebuild is to shift your problems to the
network layer, where they are way harder to see, analyze, test,
and fix.</li>
<li>That is not progress. IMO that's engineer malpractice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A much more successful treatment for hoarding is to <b>work
intensively one on one with folks</b>,
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>changing their habits slowly over time,</li>
<li>having THEM clean up the house - one little area at a time.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This is where <i>communication skills</i> come into play.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because it is not at all trivial to even <span class="underline">understand</span> the
incentive structure that got you where you are, let alone to
negotiate a new, healthier set of incentives.</li>
<li>Pathology in the hoarded codebases
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>developers don't feel they have time and/or permission to
refactor code.</li>
<li>developers see “refactoring” as a completely separate activity
from building features or fixing bugs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A key indicator of this pathology is seeing stories in the
backlog like “refactor user class.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Improvement Over Consistency
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you had good code, then sure, that (consistency is key to
good code.) would be true. But right now you don't.</li>
<li>One book on the shelf and five in the pile is better than six
books in the pile.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To actually fix it, you need to
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>negotiate with the individuals who are applying the pressure.</li>
<li>understand THEIR incentives,</li>
<li>align your desired changes with those.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You don't want begrudging acceptance. You want enthusiastic
buy-in.</li>
<li>As you improve your communication skills (by doing it badly at
first), you start to get a sense of what works for different
people.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What's limiting your ability to write good code.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is NOT:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>knowledge of the latest framework</li>
<li>how fast your tests run</li>
<li>your own weak moral fiber</li>
<li>your manager, PM, or CEO</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It IS:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how well you understand &amp; work with people</li>

Immutable objects good; Mutable objects bad

<p>
Classes should be immutable unless there's a very good reason to
make them mutable….If a class cannot be made immutable, limit its
mutability as much as possible.

<li>An object is a collection of partially applied functions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>methods MUST operate, in some way, on the state of the object</li>
<li>If they didn't operate on the object's state, they wouldn't be
partially applied.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
An object's API provides a clear separation between Commands and Queries
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Methods should return a value only if they are referentially
transparent and hence possess no side effects
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we assume we only want to return one thing from a method, and
that a change in state necessitates returning a handle to the new
state, then <b>a method can only ever be either a query or command
but not both</b>.</li>
<li>In a sense commands are now queries, eg. that ask the question:
"what would a system look like if I asked you to do something?"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An object is a snapshot of state and possible outcomes
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The methods are like the choices we make</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An object is a persistent data structure

First Round Review</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>THREE HARMFUL RECRUITING REFRAINS AT STARTUPS
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>THE REFRAIN: We test the technical knowledge and skills needed
for the role in the interview.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>THE REALITY: You don't actually know what you need. You're
figuring out what you need.</li>
<li>A stronger statement: the skills that people are hiring for are
not the skills that they often most need.</li>
<li>They haven't actually decided that interviewing and hiring is a
critical business activity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They're kind of just trying to get through it.</li>
<li>And because they want to get past it, they look for and lean
on patterns, opting to repeat what others have said or done.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>THE REFRAIN: With engineers, only technical skills truly
matter. Soft skills are a nice-to-have.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>THE REALITY: Every engineer must be equally skillful with code
and colleagues.</li>
<li>Questions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ego.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Does the candidate have low ego?</li>
<li>Will they be too protective of their code?</li>
<li>Do they have to be right?</li>
<li>Does that change how they listen to input or consider other
ideas?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adaptability.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do they know that the goal of a business is to grow and
change?</li>
<li>Have they been a part of a team that has grown where
process has had to change or team has had to be
restructured?</li>
<li>If so, how have they reacted to those changes?</li>
<li>Do they seek opportunities for their growth in that change?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Technical communication.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do they know the technical skill needed for the role?</li>
<li>Have they demonstrated the ability to apply that skill?</li>
<li>Finally, can they communicate technical complexities well?</li>
<li>Do they recognize that knowledge, application and
communication of technical know-how are separate skills to
master?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cross-functional collaboration.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can they share multiple examples of close collaboration
among individuals across functions, such as Engineering,
Product, Design, Customer support and more. Do they have an
example of when that collaboration went well?</li>
<li>When it didn't, how did they respond and resolve or bring
closure to the situation?</li>
<li>Have they proactively identified silos in an organization —
and what have they done about them?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>THE REFRAIN: We've picked a few people to interview with them —
let's get it scheduled.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>THE REALITY: Thoroughness and consistency is paramount for
optimal, unbiased results.</li>
<li>Four sessions: That's our 'right' number</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>STEPS TO TAKE TO MAKE INTERVIEWING A CRITICAL BUSINESS STRATEGY
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Interview in three-person groups.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One-on-one interview is not a great candidate experience
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One-on-one interviews tend to lead to a unidirectional
candidate-and-interviewer dynamic. A person asks a question,
the other person tries to answer it. Rinse and repeat.</li>
<li>they come away feeling grilled or discouraged after trying to
answer a bevy of questions.</li>
<li>Interviewers can also get disenchanted, when, instead of
following the thread of the conversation, must cycle through
questions like a more rigid, rote activity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add another colleague into the mix as a second interviewer.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it brings a higher fidelity and signal to the conversation</li>
<li>it breaks down the flow and nature of the conversation</li>
<li>questions and answers bouncing between three points opens up
the discussion and evaluation much more</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Three-person interviews generate more signal and meaningful
meandering than traditional 1:1 interviews.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It subtly helps reduce bias.</li>
<li>It splits the acts of engaging from observing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you send two people in, one of them is generally
observing more, as the other engages.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It simultaneously trains your more green interviewers.</li>
<li>It elevates the perspective of less experienced employees.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Everybody — the entire team — interviews.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>having more people being able to interview candidates
skillfully and efficiently is an advantage.</li>
<li>it's easier to identify members of the team who are
comfortable, confident interviewers — people who the
engineering leader can tap to serve as mentors to make less
experienced colleagues better interviewers.</li>
<li>If you don't want some people to interview, ask yourself
why. If you're worried about how they're representing the
company, there's a bigger issue at hand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Commit to doing more interviews.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>The most effective way I've found to get to the top 10% is to
interview and say no to the other 90%.</b></li>
<li>Create an interview-intensive system, stick to it, learn from
it and you'll make better hires.</li>
<li><b>Partnering with an in-house recruiter</b> has been the only way
he's been able to create a hiring system that can support many
interviews.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you need someone collaborating with you on the scale and
scheduling of all the interviews for a hiring process.</li>
<li>That's another reason why, as the hiring manager, I not only
do a final evaluation of the candidate, but also get feedback
on how the interview process went, and where it could
improve.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Round up and huddle.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Get an initial yea or nay.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a four-point scale
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>strong hire</li>
<li>hire</li>
<li>no hire</li>
<li>strong no hire</li>
</ul></li>
<li>That's the place to start. (Talk about why)</li>
<li>Two pros
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>engineers love rubrics and rooting their rationale in a
system.</li>
<li>making a ‘hire' or ‘no hire' decision upfront means
starting with the end in mind.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Amplify signal.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how did we do in this evaluation,</li>
<li>how did the candidate do in this evaluation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Surface skill bias.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is naming variables well in code really an important thing?
Yes, it is. Is it a really coachable and fixable thing? Yes
that's true. So it shouldn't disqualify people. That's why we
do code reviews. We teach this.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Spotlight who's making the decision — and how.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Acknowledge the value of each interviewer's contribution,
but also convey that owning part of the process isn't the
same as owning the decision.</li>
<li>Bring visibility to your thought process. (Try to give the
team more insight into how I'm making decisions)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>TYING IT ALL TOGETHER
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Step zero is asking: <i>are you getting enough different data
points in an interview process?</i></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The single most important bit of "wisdom on TDD techniques":
<b>the tests are telling you how to improve your design, so listen!</b></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/beyond-mock-objects">Beyond Mock Objects - The Code Whisperer</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Events and return values are the same thing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many side-effects are events with a single, mandatory listener.</li>
<li>You can replace side-effects with a value that represents the
side-effect and then push the event listener up the call stack.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similarly, suppliers and values are the same thing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many times we write code that depends on suppliers, when we have
the opportunity to replace that with code that depends on the
values it supplies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It doesn’t matter which design you choose if you see the
equivalence between options. (As long as you can refactor between
them)</li>
<li>Removing mock objects is not a goal; it’s an option.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mock Objects Are Just Doing Their Job

constant positive pressure on my design and they alert me to
