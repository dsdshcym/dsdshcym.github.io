<p>
One thing I noticed a lot in my work or daily life is that: people
(including me) tend to think, <b>a lot</b>. But like this article said,
most of our thoughts are just useless. And they are affecting our
productivity because of two reasons:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Our time is limited. If we spend too much time on these useless
thoughts, we would have less time on working or thinking the right
things.</li>
<li>A huge parts of these useless thoughts prevent us from doing the
real work.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A great example is from an intern I'm mentoring these days:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In our first-week review meeting, she said that she was afraid that
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>her change would break the app badly because she was not familiar
with development (Rails, Git, etc.)</li>
<li>her work (code format, commit messages, etc.) could not meet the
company guideline/standard</li>
<li>her interruptions (asking questions, status updates, etc.) would
cause trouble to other team members.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Due to these thoughts, she didn't take many actions in her first
week.</li>
<li>But from my point of view, these thoughts are useless because:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If her change breaks the app, we still have Git to recover
everything. And she needs more "efforts" to break our codebase on
our GitLab server, given that we have branch protection and code
reviews.</li>
<li>If her work doesn't meet the company standards, her mentor would
point it out. And as an intern, it's important to make mistakes
and learn from them.</li>
<li>"Projects fail from under-communicating, not over-communicating"
(From <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/02/05/clippings-from-the-effective-enginner/">The Effective Enginner</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org970aaad">Stop Thinking in Your <i>Team</i></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org970aaad">
<p>
Sometimes, we as a team would make the same mistake as well. If you
think of every member of this team as a part of our brain, and the
communication between them as the team talking to itself (or thinking
in its brain), you'll find that the team also over-thinks, <b>a
lot</b>. Here are some examples:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Adding too many features without talking to the customer.</li>
<li>Coming up with many edge-cases to make the app "perfect" (bug-free,
resilient, performant, etc.).</li>
<li>Arguing about two different solutions rather than A/B testing them.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thinking too much as a team would hurt as much, if not more, as a
person.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, we can use the same solution above to fight that:
<b>Awareness</b>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some signs that the team is thinking too much:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Long meetings/discussions/debates</li>
<li>No new releases for quite some time</li>
<li>Polished wireframes that may take weeks/months/years to build</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Every time we discover these signs, we need to become aware of our
"thinking" and stop them immediately.</li>
<li>Start taking real actions and "let the world push you towards more
complexities".</li>
</ul>
