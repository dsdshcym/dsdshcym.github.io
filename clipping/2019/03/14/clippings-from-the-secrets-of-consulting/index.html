<li><p>
The Number One Secret:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Consulting ain't as easy as it looks.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
SHERBIE'S LAWS OF CONSULTING
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In spite of what your client may tell you, there's always a
problem.</li>
<li>No matter how it looks at first, it's always a people problem.</li>
<li>Never forget they're paying you by the hour, not by the solution</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's Always a Problem
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the culture of management, the worst thing you can do is
admit to anyone that you have a problem you can't handle by
yourself.</li>
<li>If you really do need help, you have to sneak it in somehow
without admitting in public that there is any problem at all.</li>
<li><p>
Corollary: The Ten Percent Promise
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Never promise more than ten percent improvement.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you promise too much improvement, they'll never hire you,
because that would force them to admit they had a problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Corollary: The Ten Percent Solution
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you happen to achieve more than ten percent improvement, make
sure it isn't noticed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The best way to make sure it isn't noticed, of course, is to
help the client take all the credit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's Always a People Problem
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One way for managers to avoid mentioning that they have a
problem is to label the problem a "technical problem."</li>
<li>Even when it's "really" a technical problem, it can always be
traced back to management action or inaction.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Even so, the experienced consultant will resist pointing out
that it was management who hired all the technical people and
is responsible for their development.</li>
<li>look for the people who should have prevented this problem, or
dealt with it when it arose.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Corollary: Marvin's Law
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Whatever the client is doing, advise something else.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At the very least, the people problem is either lack of
imagination or lack of perspective.</li>
<li>People who are close to a problem tend to keep repeating what
didn't work the first time.</li>
<li>Every hard-working person loses perspective at times</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Never forget they're paying you by the hour
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To get paid by the solution, you would first have to get the
client to admit that there was a problem, then that the problem
was big enough to justify paying you well for solving if</li>
<li><p>
Corollary: The Credit Rule
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You'll never accomplish anything if you care who gets the credit
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In corset for a consultant to get credit, the client would
have to admit there had been a solution &lt;- a problem</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The Fourth Law of Consulting
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If they didn't hire you, don't solve their problem.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it usually backfires.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
THE LAW OF RASPBERRY JAM
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The wider you spread it, the thinner it gets.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it's up to my client to implement the ideas.</li>
<li>What I lose in quality, I gain in quantity.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can advise two other people on how to do the job in my
absence.</li>
<li>Training is merely a cheaper form of consulting.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each participant gets a little less, but the cost goes down, so the market for my message expands.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The wider the audience, the more you can make. (The less influence
you have on each of them)</li>
<li>Influence or affluence; take your choice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
WEINBERGS' LAW OF TWINS
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Most of the time, for most of the world, no matter how hard people
work at it, nothing of any significance happens.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In other words, for most systems in the world, the best prediction
about their behavior in the next instant is just what they were
doing in the previous instant.</li>
<li>Weinbergs' Law tells them that most of their efforts (to change)
will come to naught, even if they only want to change themselves.</li>
<li>I can remove one problem that's my worst, but it always leaves
another that used to be my second worst.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Rudy's Rutabaga Rule:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Once you eliminate your number one problem, number two gets a
promotion.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>there's <i>always</i> another problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The Hard Law
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you can't accept failure, you'll never succeed as a consultant.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you can't accept failure, you'll never succeed as a consultant.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The Harder Law
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to find the problem in any situation is the consultant's
best asset.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you must give up the illusion that you'll ever finish solving
problems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The Hardest Law
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Helping myself is even harder than helping others.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That's essentially what this book is about.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Consultants deal in change
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The time people do need a consultant is when logic isn't working. They are <i>stuck</i>.</li>

<li>WHY PARADOX?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't be rational; be reasonable.</li>
<li>People who think they know everything's are easiest to fool</li>

<li>"We must do it in the best possible way." -&gt;
<i>"What are you willing to sacrifice?"</i></li>
<li>Tradeoff Charts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The tradeoff chart indicates that if you want to run faster,
you'll have to restrict yourself to a shorter distance, assuming
that all other factors are kept the same.</li>
<li>The Tradeoff Treatment: <b>You don't get nothin' for nothin'</b></li>
<li>Optimitis can be a confusing disease because people fail to
recognize the limiting nature of the tradeoff chart</li>

<li>The Tradeoff Treatment
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Moving in one direction incurs a cost in the other.</b></li>

<li>TIME TRADEOFFS
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Now Versus Later
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the problem of balancing certainty now versus uncertainty in the
future.</li>
<li>If I knew for sure what I would need later, there would be no
tradeoff problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fisher's Fundamental Theorem
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>The better adapted you are, the less adaptable you tend to be.</b></li>
<li>In hiring, older people who are more experienced vs. younger
people who may prove more adaptable
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>my bias tends to be toward investing in the future</li>
<li>people tend to overestimate the time it takes to acquire a
skill</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Training policies, the same tradeoff (better adapted to present
task vs. future tasks)</li>
<li>Consultants are less adapted to the present situation, and
therefore are potentially more adaptable.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Their perception of now/then tradeoffs is different from those
close to the problem, which makes them a valuable source of
ideas.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Risk Versus Certainty
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I toss a coin. If it comes up heads, I give you $2.10. If it comes
up tails, I give you nothing. Now, consider how much you would pay
to play the game?
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
The Third-Time Charm
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Consultants tend to be most effective on the third problem you
give them.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By working with a client for an extended period of time, it's
possible to establish trust by recommending only low-risk
alternatives.</li>
<li>This strategy is another now/then tradeoff: <i>small results now
for the possibility of bigger results later.</i></li>

<li>THE PROBLEM WITH SPECIALISTS
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Elephant in the Boardroom</li>
<li>Out of Your Depth
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Three times out of four, consultants find themselves asked to
work on problems that aren't really their "specialty."</li>
<li>The consultant just looks like a specialist to a nonspecialist.</li>
<li>Good consultants are <b>problem-solvers</b>, in addition to being
specialists</li>

<li>MARVIN'S MEDICAL SECRETS
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ninety percent of all illness cures itself— with absolutely no
intervention from the doctor.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Deal gently with systems that should be able to cure
themselves.</i></li>
<li><b>If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repeatedly curing a system that can cure itself will eventually
create a system that can't.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Of the ten percent of illnesses that don't cure themselves,
penicillin or some other antibiotic handily dispatches another
ninety percent</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Every prescription has two parts: the medicine and the method of
ensuring correct use.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Follow up suggestions</li>
<li>Don't give up the treatment too soon.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If what they've been doing hasn't solved the problem, tell them
to do something else.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't stick with the treatment too long.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make sure they pay you enough so they'll do what you say.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>The most important act in consulting is setting the right
fee.</i></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Know-how pays much less than know-when.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For a consultant, "clever" behavior is "crazy" behavior done
when it works.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>FEATURING FAILURE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Bolden Rule: <i>If you can't fix it, feature it.</i></li>
<li>Featuring Your Own Failures
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That's one risk of applying The Bolden Rule: People may begin to
believe you're perfect (which isn't too bad, as long as you
don't start believing it yourself).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>FAKING SUCCESS
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Gilded Rule: <i>If you can't feature it, fake it.</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because faking always seems so much easier than fixing.</li>
<li>Once fakery works, we stop learning how to do real fixery.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Inverse Gilded Rule: <i>If something's faked, it must need
fixing.</i></li>
<li>The Gilded Consultant
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If they (the clients) catch you lying, they'll figure out that
you must have something to hide.</li>
<li>Even if it merely sounds like you're lying, you're in trouble.</li>

Sparks's Law of Problem Solution

<blockquote>
<p>
The chances of solving a problem decline the closer you get to
finding out who was the cause of the problem.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The people who were part of the process that produced the
problem are still around and will be involved, in one way or
another, in the attempts to solve it.</li>

producing the present mess, you may then discover that
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There were, at the time, good and sufficient reasons for
decisions that seem idiotic today.</li>

philosophy. The optimist declares,"This is the best of all possible
worlds." The pessimist sighs and says, "You're right."

<li>MISSING TOOLS
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The absence of some tool <del>for tabulating complaints</del> was a sign of
<del>quality</del> problems
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The feedback (from these tools) would have eventually led to
changes <del>in quality</del></li>

REASONING FROM WHAT ISN'T THERE
</p>

<p>
There are few new tools, although there are new ways to use old
tools.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
The Level Law
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Effective problem-solvers may have many problems, but rarely have
a single, dominant problem.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As you keep solving your worst problem, the percent of trouble
caused by your worst problem will diminish, and your remaining
problems will tend to become relatively equal in percentage.</li>
<li>To the extent that The Level Law holds true, a consultant can
learn quite a bit about a client by observing the distribution
of trouble across the existing problems.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The fact that no one major problem exists implies that some
effective problem-solving mechanisms are already in place.</li>
<li>Even though you may not solve any spectacular problem, you can
identify the client's favorite problem-solving mechanisms in
order to use them in your own suggested methods. This should
make you look good to the client.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Missing Solution
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If one problem accounts for a major part of all the trouble, and
has done so for some time, the client is evidently not terribly
effective at problem-solving and has not been concentrating on
problems in a worst-first manner.</li>
<li>Instead of looking for existing problem-solving mechanisms, you
may want to
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>do something simple that will knock out a visible chunk of
the big problem and do it in such a way as to increase your
credibility</li>
<li>then use your credibility to gain a commitment of some
resources to start on the next chunk.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A better approach may be to ignore the big problem initially and
work to establish the clients' own problem-solving mechanisms.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Choose something simple and relatively certain of success</li>
<li>Let the clients learn how to solve their own problems
themselves.</li>
<li>An added benefit is that they will gain needed confidence.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Missing History
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's important to look not only at the distribution of problems,
but the history of that distribution.</li>
<li>If the preponderant problem is something recent, perhaps
introduced by some sudden external event, it's probably a good
strategy to attack the problem directly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Missing Request for Help
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People who are so poor at solving problems very seldom ask for
outside help.</li>
<li>When the request is missing, chances are you can't help.</li>
<li>Make sure that you've actually been asked.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>HOW TO SEE WHAT ISN'T THERE
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Be Aware of Your Own Limitations
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Find out what you usually miss and design a tool to ensure that
you don't miss it again.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's one thing that's not missing in every single one of your
consulting situations: you.</li>
<li>I write my understanding of the request in my notebook and ask
the client to read and approve it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use Other People
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When it comes to seeing what's missing, diversity is your ally.</li>
<li>Pose the question "What am I missing?" to as many people as you
can find.</li>
<li>Recruit people at different levels, with different roles, and
with different backgrounds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Investigate Other Cultures
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I make a particular effort to get consulting assignments outside
the United States, because they open my eyes to what's missing
in my own culture, as well as to things I've always taken for
granted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use Laundry Lists
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rather than rely on your memory of other situations, it's
sometimes useful to develop explicit lists of items that may be
missing.</li>
<li>A laundry list reminds you of the different items that you
<i>might</i> have forgotten, but that just might need cleaning up.</li>
<li>When working in poorly defined situations, you probably can't
say in advance what elements <i>must</i> be present for success, so a
laundry list is preferred.</li>
<li>It's also important not to grow too confident about your list,
lest you become even more likely to miss something critical.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check the Process
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A laundry list can also be used to determine whether your search
for missing things has been effective.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Keep your laundry list in reserve until after you have your
own list of missing items.</li>
<li>Then compare the two lists.</li>
<li>If the laundry list brings up new items, perhaps your
original process of thinking up missing items wasn't that
comprehensive.</li>
<li>Try changing the process in some way and continue working.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
Although a good process won't ensure that you see everything, a
poor process will almost certainly cause you to overlook
something.
</p>
<pre class="example">
When working with an organization, I may conduct a meeting to identify
missing items. If a meeting is dominated by one or two individuals, I
know that I'm not getting the ideas of all the others. I try to keep
the dominant individuals under control, but if I can't, I terminate
the meeting. Then I meet the participants individually in an
environment more conducive to their participation.
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Any indication that your process was poor is an indication
that a new process should be fruitful.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
ON BEING RIDICULOUS
</p>

<p>
If I don't come up with a few unreasonable items, then the process
has been too conservative.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Weinberg's Law of Fetch
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sometimes farfetched is only shortsighted.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
The Rule of Three
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you can't think of three things that might go wrong with your
plans, then there's something wrong with your thinking.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Wanting to be right all the time makes it especially difficult
to notice what's missing in your own thought processes.</b></li>
<li>The Rule of Three can be used to check any thinking process.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>LOOSENING UP YOUR THINKING
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Look for Analogies
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Think of some system that is somehow like the one you're
examining, then use it as a source of ideas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Move to Extremes
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You don't expect these things to happen, but playing with them
in your mind distorts the current system and lets you see things
that were previously concealed by reasonableness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look Outside the Boundary
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The boundary between one part of a system and another is a good
place to look for missing things—those things that each part
assumes are taken care of by the other part</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look for Alibis Versus Explanations
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many written rules are instituted as quick fixes for problems
that happened once in the past.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Emotional Component
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Consultants rarely get called when the client's rational methods
have been working well, so something different is always needed.</li>
<li>One approach is to use a different rational method, but it may
be more promising to be a bit irrational</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The Incongruence Insight
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When words and music (the emotions being expressed) don't go
together, they point to a missing element.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What is missing in these cases is <i>congruence</i> between the words
being used and the emotions being expressed</li>
<li>The ability to sense incongruence is the consultant's most
powerful "What's missing?" tool</li>
<li>The most effective method of finding that element is simply to
comment on the incongruity and allow the client to respond.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I didn't try to interpret this incongruence, but merely
brought it to his conscious attention.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
BROWN'S BRILLIANT BEQUEST
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Words are often useful, but it always pays to listen to the music
(especially your own internal music).
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The music you hear from the client is only the external sound of
an internal emotional state that you cannot, of course, know
directly.</li>
<li>But you can know your own emotional state directly, and your own
emotional state tends to be quite sensitive to the client's music</li>
<li>When you feel something strong going on inside yourself, capture
it and start listening to the client's music for clues about its
origin.</li>
<li>Or, comment about it to the client.</li>
<li>Which brings us full circle, back to <b>knowing yourself</b>, which is
where all good consulting work originates</li>

started, and what time they finished.</li>

<li>In each of these cases, there's no requirement to do anything

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The more you try to obey the suggestion, the more you violate
it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Seeing Internal Behavior
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Hidden Agenda is one of the techniques I use to train people
to "see" inside others.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Before a meeting begins, I give each participant a sheet of
paper on which is written a secret personal assignment for
that meeting.</li>
<li>Here are some examples of such secret assignments:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try to see to it that every decision the meeting takes is
written down and displayed so all can view it.</li>
<li>Make sure that every person gets a chance to talk on every
topic.</li>
<li>Do not let any single person or clique dominate the meeting.</li>
<li>Pretend that you have not prepared for this meeting, and try
to conceal that fact from everyone else throughout the
entire meeting.</li>
<li>If at all possible, see that the meeting comes to decision X
without letting yourself be identified with that decision.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By playing the role explicitly, the actor learns to "see"
behavior that was previously invisible, or to see alternative
interpretations for behavior that was previously visible.</li>
<li>the best way to speed a meeting's progress is simply to keep
quiet.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pretend you have another meeting to attend following this
one. You very much want to attend that meeting, so do
everything you can to make this meeting end as quickly as
possible.</li>
<li>Pretend you have another meeting to attend following this
one. You very much want to miss that meeting, which you can
do if this one runs overtime. Do everything you can to make
this meeting last as long as possible.</li>

<li>Seeing Feelings
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>seeing feelings is more important than seeing thoughts,</li>
<li>In order to get people more in touch with themselves, I used to
ask them to write down their feelings in a personal journal.</li>
<li>It's not that people hadn't understood the question, but that
they were blind to feelings.</li>
<li>Yet without that first glimpse, the request to write about their
feelings is literally as meaningless as asking a blind person to
write about the color of an elephant's eyes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>THE POWERFUL CONSULTANT
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your task is to influence people, but only at their request.</li>
<li>You strive to make people less dependent on you, rather than more
dependent.</li>
<li>You try to obey The Law of the Jiggle: The less you actually
intervene, the better you feel about your work.</li>
<li>If your clients want help in solving problems, you are able to say
no.</li>
<li>If you say yes but fail, you can live with that. If you succeed,
the least satisfying approach is when you solve the problem for
them.</li>
<li>More satisfying is to help them solve their problems in such a way
that they will be more likely to solve the next problem without
help.</li>
<li>Most satisfying is to help them learn how to prevent problems in
the first place.</li>
<li>You can be satisfied with your accomplishments, even if clients
don't give you credit.</li>
<li>Your ideal form of influence is first to help people see their
world more clearly, and then to let them decide what to do next.</li>
<li>Your methods of working are always open for display and discussion
with your clients.</li>
<li>Your primary tool is merely being the person you are, so your most
powerful method of helping other people is to help yourself.</li>

Much of the change I see is motivated by crises.

The Struggle to Preserve

When change is inevitable, we struggle most to keep what we value

Illusions Only Make It Worse
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When you create an illusion, to prevent or soften change, the
change becomes more likely—and harder to take.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most real change is a slow process. Like aging.</li>
<li>But when we build illusions to hide the change, we soon find
ourselves spending all our energy maintaining the
illusions. That keeps us from dealing with change while it's
still small.</li>
<li>It's the crash of illusions that makes us believe change happens
as crises."</li>
<li>Whatever approach you use, do it in an open, clear manner.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>because when difficult changes begin, truth is always a scarce
commodity.</li>
<li>If you really care about "protecting" people, don't ever
"protect" them from the truth.</li>

  cost by thirty percent?"

  procedures?"
- "What one thing could we change in this plan that would make the
  most difference to you?"
- "If the Good Fairy granted you just one wish about this plan, what
  would it be?"

<b>prevent it (the plan) from becoming frozen in place</b></li>
<li>The purpose is to <b>help the client to solve a problem</b>, not to
demonstrate my superior intelligence or dominant will</li>
<li>When I can't get past the resistance, I try not to take it
personally</li>
<li>When an impasse reaches a certain point, it's best simply to
let go and announce, "I'm afraid this one is too big for me. I
hope you'll solve it, but I can't think of anything else that
might help you."</li>
<li>What amazes me most is that as soon as I let go, the client's
resistance usually collapses. <b>It's hard to resist when
nobody's pushing.</b></li>

<li>THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST REGRET
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<a id="org6181e90"></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Set the price so you won't regret it either way.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Two possibilities
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Accepted</li>
<li>Rejected
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Whenever I'm turned down for a job and then regret my high
price, I try to make a mental note so that on the next
similar job, I'll shave the price a little.</li>
<li>But if I'm turned down and don't regret it, I leave the price
alone.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>To apply The Ninth Law, I must know my feelings about money, time,
travel, and varieties of work.</li>
<li>always set the price so as not to destroy the price as an
effective consulting tool.
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Too low</dt><dd><a href="#org611d4c5">2.1</a></dd>
<dt>Too high</dt><dd><p>
I'll feel that I'm not able to deliver something of
value equal to what is being paid.
</p>

<p>
Too high a price might make me push too hard for results that
            aren't really possible to obtain.

<li>FEE AS FEELING

<a id="org6fdd306"></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
All prices are ultimately based on feelings, both yours and
theirs.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>I just lay out several prices in a range and than imagine myself
in a situation in which I'm turned down and am sitting at home, or
the situation in which I've accepted and I'm doing the job. Based
on where I feel best on all sides, I set my price.</li>
