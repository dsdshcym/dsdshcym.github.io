<h2 id="orgc68fa44">Processes that kills communication</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc68fa44">
<p>
I'm getting more pains than gains from some processes. Here are a few
examples that can kill communication if executed badly:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Sprint Meetings</dt><dd><p>
From my current understanding, Sprint Meeting is a place for the
whole team to review the previous sprint and discuss the goal for
the next sprint.
</p>

<p>
But I saw people using them to discuss issues, rather than
goals. They check each tasks in their issues list one by one. And
see if they can close them. Then they create new tasks for the
next sprint.
</p>

<p>
Even worse, people are waiting for a sprint meeting to discuss
issue details. There are few (or even no) discussions happening
in issues, over Slack chats, not even in Email threads. The only
items in an issue are a bunch of commit hashes related to this
issue. And then PMs and developers check if each task is done
until the Sprint Meeting.
</p>

<p>
In the end, this kind of Sprint Meeting becomes Task
Planning. And I think it completely misses the point of this
process.
</p></dd>
<dt>Daily Stand-ups</dt><dd><p>
Like Sprint Meetings, Daily Stand-ups are also goal-oriented and
are hold to reduce risks.
</p>

<p>
But when executed badly, this meeting can become meaningless. It
feels like a personal task report meeting to me. Everyone just
talk about what issues/tasks they are going to work on today. And
they never have chats around these tasks, the risks, nor the
goals.
</p>

<p>
Even worse, people don't even listen anymore.
</p>

<p>
When a person has repeated the same task for several days, no one
ask why it's still not finished or how's the progress on it.
</p>

<p>
When a person says "I am going to build a rocket and fly it to
Mars today" for fun, no one laughs for this joke nor gets angry
for this non-related topic.

</ul></dd>
<dt>Focus Time (No Communication Time)</dt><dd><p>
Some companies have this policy for communication: we discourage
people to interrupt others during a specific time everyday. No
talk, no Slack, no email. The goal was to give people a regular
time to focus on coding, writing, etc.
</p>

<p>
I really believe this process was a productivity boost when it
was first implemented (thought I was not there). People felt more
productive because they were free of meetings and discussions
during the Focus Time.
</p>

<p>
But then the Focus Time helps to build a "silent" culture. People
tends to interrupt others less, even out of the Focus Time. And
it turns out to be that if you want to communicate with others,
you have to interrupt others first. So without these necessary
interruptions, less communications can happen. People then reply
on other processes (like daily stand-ups, sprint meetings) to
communicate, which then builds up a negative feedback loop.

<div id="outline-container-org4cc5bf4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4cc5bf4">What if these processes are all gone?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4cc5bf4">
<p>
I wish I can remove these processes all at once and rebuild a culture
that encourages communications. As mentioned in <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/say-no-to-more-process-say-yes-to-trust">Say no to more
process, say yes to trust</a> before: to replace these processes, we need
to <b>clearly communicate problems and possible solutions</b> and to <b>trust
your team to implement them</b>.
</p>

<p>
Take Focus Time for example.
</p>

<p>
The ideas behind Focus Time are great:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>respect others' time</li>
<li>focus on your own work</li>
</ol>

<p>
We can still achieve both without this process. We only need to
provide several possible solutions to the team and trust everyone to
make their best judgments. A few examples I can think of now:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>respect others' time
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>hold meetings more efficiently</li>
<li>use asynchronous and synchronous message tools accordingly</li>
</ol></li>
<li>learn to focus on your own work
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>use "Do Not Disturb" features provided by our tools
(macOS, Slack, Gmail)</li>
<li>set your own "focus time" on your calendar so others can see
it when scheduling a meeting</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>
With a few training and mentoring sessions, I believe the result would
be much better than a Focus Time policy.
</p>

<p>
The same goes for both Sprint Meeting and Daily Stand-ups: we can
absolutely find our own alternatives to satisfy our needs.
</p>

<p>
After all, stop doing something has almost no risks because we can
always roll back to using them again.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want you to stop because this is a very simple, low-risk
experiment you can do.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You need <b>no preparation</b> at all</li>
<li>Just stop the doing the daily standup, and <b>make everyone record
what they are missing.</b></li>
<li><b>By stopping completely, you get a much better idea why you need
the daily standup than by trying to change it in baby steps.</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org10d0570">Why would processes backfire?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org10d0570">
<p>
This experiment demonstrates the situation of how a process backfires
perfectly:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start with a cage containing five apes. In the cage hang a banana
on a string and put stairs under it. Before long an ape will go to
the stairs in order to climb up and reach the banana.</li>
<li>As soon as he touches the stairs all the apes are sprayed with cold
water. After a while, another ape makes an attempt with the same
result —all the apes are sprayed with shocking cold water. This
continues for a few more times with each attempt.</li>
<li>Turn off the cold water. Later on, if another ape tries to climb
the stairs, the other apes —to avoid getting sprayed with cold
water— will try to prevent the ape from climbing the stairs even
though no water is actually sprayed on them.</li>
<li>Now, remove one ape from the cage and replace it with a new
ape. The new ape sees the banana and —not knowing of previous
events— wants to climb the stairs. To his horror, all of the other
apes attack him. After another attempt and attack he knows that if
he tries to climb up the stairs, he will be assaulted.</li>
<li>Next, remove another of the original five apes and replace it with
a new one. The newcomer goes to the stairs to get to the banana and
is attacked. The previous newcomer (of #4) also takes part in the
punishment with enthusiasm.</li>
<li>Again, replace a third original ape with a new one. The new one
makes it to the stairs and is attacked as well. Two of the four
apes that beat him have no idea why they were not permitted to
climb the stairs in the first place, or why they are participating
in the beating of the newest ape.</li>
<li>After replacing the fourth and fifth original apes, all the apes
that have been sprayed with cold water have been
replaced. Nevertheless, no ape ever again approaches the stairs in
order to climb up to get the banana.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
-- from <a href="https://www.luisprada.com/bureaucracy_in_the_planet_of_the_apes/">Bureaucracy in the Planet of the Apes - Brother Veritus' Website</a>
</p>

<p>
You can understand this experiment in the context of process:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Team members are just like apes. Some old team members exit the
team, and some new team members join the team.</li>
<li>Building a new feature is like getting that banana every ape wants.</li>
<li>Issues would happen inevitably when building a new feature. When
an issue occurs, it feels exactly like the shocking cold water.</li>
<li>Then, we introduce a process (prevent the one from climbing the
stairs) to prevent the shocking cold water from spraying again.</li>
<li>Even though <i>the issue is gone</i> (no water is sprayed again) and <i>all
team members are replaced</i> (all the apes are replaced), the process
remains.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That's the power of the process, or the power of team momentum.
</p>

<p>
So why would this happen and how to prevent it?
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
We forget the value behind the process.
</p>

<p>
All processes are practices, by definition. And <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/04/11/values-and-practices/">there are always
values behind a practice</a>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The intended value behind Focus Time is the respect for others'
time and focused working hours.</li>
<li>The intended value behind the Apes Bureaucracy is everyone's
physical safety.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If we didn't make these values clear when introducing practices,
it's easy for the new comer to misunderstand them.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Respect for others' time becomes communicating less.</li>
<li>Physical safety becomes that stairs/banana are dangerous.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
The process is not implemented by those who practice it.
</p>

<p>
Only those who face the problem and practice the process can fully
understand the value behind the process.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why not managers?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Often, managers and executives suggest process because it will
help them better command, control, coordinate, or communicate.</li>
<li>New process should never be implemented in the service of these
goals, because its benefit is illusory and often highly
overestimated:</li>
<li>managers can perceive its benefits to them, but because they are
at least one (or more) levels removed from the direct operation,
they do not perceive its true costs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why individuals?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>individuals doing hands-on work (e.g. engineers) can easily
recognize when it is appropriate to add elements of organization
or process,</li>
<li>as they have a more direct ability to see how the benefits would
outweigh the costs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What should managers do?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Managers will need to suppress their natural fear that things are
too chaotic or out of control due to the lack of visibility into
details.</li>
<li>They should focus on
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>leading by setting accurate and informative context and
goals</b>,</li>
<li>facilitating the natural organization that results from
collaboration between technology workers (who are often not the
type prone to falling into anarchy anyhow).</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
-- from <a href="http://algeri-wong.com/yishan/engineering-management-process.html">Let process be implemented by those who practice it</a>
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
So we need to let process be implemented by those who practice it. And
remember to let them explain the values behind these practices. The
best scenario after each practice is done is that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We fix the issue by this practice we introduced.</li>
<li>We learn the values from this practice.</li>
<li>Next time we encounter a similar issue, we use the values we have
to come up a better practice to fix it. After all, we are not going
to face the exactly same issue again.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let me know what you think of Processes in the comment below! I would
be happy to discuss them.
