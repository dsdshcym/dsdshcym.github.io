The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it
has taken place.—GEORGE BERNARD SHAW

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The crucial conversations we’re referring to are interactions that
happen to everyone. They’re the day-to-day conversations that affect
your life.</li>
<li>What makes one of your conversations crucial as opposed to plain
vanilla?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>opinions vary.</li>
<li>stakes are high.</li>
<li>emotions run strong.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What makes each of these conversations crucial—and not simply
challenging, frustrating, frightening, or annoying—is that <b>the
results could have a huge impact on the quality of your life.</b></li>
<li>Despite the importance of crucial conversations, we often back away
from them because we fear we’ll make matters worse.</li>

<h3 id="orgff28082">HOW DO WE TYPICALLY HANDLE CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgff28082">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In truth, when we face crucial conversations, we can do one of three
things:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We can avoid them.</li>
<li>We can face them and handle them poorly.</li>
<li>We can face them and handle them well.</li>
</ol></li>

<h4 id="org19db311">When It Matters Most, We Do Our Worst</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org19db311">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why is that?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We’re designed wrong.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>emotions don’t exactly prepare us to converse effectively.</li>
<li>Countless generations of genetic shaping drive humans to handle crucial conversations with flying fists and fleet feet, not intelligent persuasion and gentle attentiveness.</li>
<li>You don’t choose to do this. Your adrenal glands do it, and then you have to live with it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We’re under pressure.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Crucial conversations are frequently spontaneous.</li>
<li>More often than not, they come out of nowhere.</li>
<li>And since you’re caught by surprise, you’re forced to conduct an extraordinarily complex human interaction in real time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We’re stumped.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You don’t know where to start.</li>
<li>you haven’t often seen real-life models of effective communication skills.</li>
<li>practice doesn’t make perfect; <i>perfect</i> practice makes perfect.</li>
<li>first you have to know what to practice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We act in self-defeating ways.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unfortunately (and here’s where the problem becomes self-defeating), the more you snip and snap, the less your loved one wants to be around you.</li>
<li>Your behavior is now actually creating the very thing you didn’t want in the first place.</li>
<li>You’re caught in an unhealthy, self-defeating loop.</li>
<li>The more the two of you push each other, the more you create the very behaviors you both despise.</li>

<h3 id="orgca6bd02">OUR AUDACIOUS CLAIM</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgca6bd02">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our research has shown that strong relationships, careers,
organizations, and communities all draw from the same source of
power: <b>the ability to talk openly about high-stakes, emotional,
controversial topics.</b></li>
<li>The Law of Crucial Conversations
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At the heart of almost all chronic problems in our organizations,
our teams, and our relationships lie crucial conversations—ones
that we’re either not holding or not holding well.</li>
<li>the key skill of effective leaders, teammates, parents, and loved
ones is the capacity to skillfully address emotionally and
politically risky issues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Here are just a few examples of these fascinating findings.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Kick-Start Your Career
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>individuals who are the most influential—who can get things
done and at the same time build on relationships—are those who
master their crucial conversations.</li>
<li>high performers know how to stand up to the boss without
committing career suicide.</li>
<li>People who routinely hold crucial conversations and hold them
well are able to express controversial and even risky opinions
in a way that gets heard.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Improve Your Organization
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More often than not, the world changes when people have to deal
with a very risky issue and either do it poorly or do it well.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Silence kills. (Nurse and doctor)</li>
<li>Silence fails. (people work in silos.)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The predictor of success or failure was whether people could
hold five specific crucial conversations.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, could they speak up if they thought the scope
and schedule were unrealistic?</li>
<li>Or did they go silent when a cross-functional team member
began sloughing off?</li>
<li>Or even more tricky—what should they do when an executive
failed to provide leadership for the effort?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Companies with employees who are skilled at crucial
conversations:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Respond five times faster to financial downturns—and make
budget adjustments far more intelligently than
less-skilled peers (Research Study: Financial Agility).</li>
<li>Are two-thirds more likely to avoid injury and death due
to unsafe conditions (Research Study: Silent Danger).</li>
<li>Save over $1,500 and an eight-hour workday for every
crucial conversation employees hold rather than avoid
(Research Study: The Costs of Conflict Avoidance).</li>
<li>Substantially increase trust and reduce transaction costs
in virtual work teams. Those who can’t handle their
crucial conversations suffer in thirteen different ways
(backstabbing, gossip, undermining, passive aggression,
etc.) as much as three times more often in virtual teams
than in colocated teams (Research Study: Long-Distance
Loathing).</li>
<li>Influence change in colleagues who are bullying,
conniving, dishonest, or incompetent. When over 4,000
respondents were asked, 93 percent of them said that, in
their organization, people like this are almost
“untouchable”—staying in their position four years or
longer without being held accountable (Research Study:
Corporate Untouchables).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Most leaders get it wrong.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They think that organizational productivity and
performance are simply about policies, processes,
structures, or systems.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So when their software product doesn’t ship on time,
they benchmark others’ development <i>processes</i>.</li>
<li>Or when productivity flags, they tweak their performance
management <i>system</i>.</li>
<li>When teams aren’t cooperating, they <i>restructure</i>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>these types of nonhuman changes fail more often than they
succeed.</li>
<li>the real problem never was in the process, system, or
structure—it was in employee <i>behavior</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The key to real change lies not in implementing a new
process, but in <b>getting people to hold one another
accountable to the process.</b></li>
<li>And that requires Crucial Conversations skills.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The path to high productivity passes not through a static
system, but through face-to-face conversations.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the worst companies, poor performers are first
ignored and then transferred.</li>
<li>In good companies, bosses eventually deal with problems.</li>
<li>In the best companies, everyone holds everyone else
accountable—regardless of level or position.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Improve Your Relationships
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>when you ask the average person what causes couples to break up,
he or she usually suggests that it’s due to differences of
opinion.</li>
<li>In truth, everyone argues about important issues. But not
everyone splits up. It’s <i>how</i> you argue that matters.</li>
<li>people fall into three categories—
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>those who digress into threats and name-calling,</li>
<li>those who revert to silent fuming,</li>
<li>those who speak openly, honestly, and effectively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>helping couples learn to hold crucial conversations more
effectively reduced the chance of unhappiness or breakup by more
than half!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Improve Your Personal Health
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the ability to master high-stakes discussions is a key to a
healthier and longer life</li>
<li>Immune systems.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>immune systems of couples who had been married an average of
forty-two years by comparing those who argued constantly with
those who resolved their differences effectively.</li>
<li>Those who routinely failed their crucial conversations had far
weaker immune systems than those who found a way to resolve
them well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Life-threatening diseases.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the subjects who learned how to express themselves effectively
had a higher survival rate</li>
<li>the negative feelings we hold in, the emotional pain we
suffer, and the constant battering we endure as we stumble our
way through unhealthy conversations slowly eat away at our
health.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In some cases the impact of failed conversations leads to
minor problems.</li>
<li>In others it results in disaster.</li>
<li>In all cases, failed conversations never make us happier,
healthier, or better off.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<h4 id="org2893868">Filling the Pool of Shared Meaning</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2893868">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings,
theories, and experiences about the topic at hand.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This unique combination of thoughts and feelings makes up our
<i>personal pool of meaning</i>.</li>
<li>This pool not only informs us, but also propels our every action.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When two or more of us enter crucial conversations, by definition we
don’t share the same pool.</li>
<li>People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to <b>make it safe
for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>even ideas that at first glance appear controversial, wrong, or at
odds with their own beliefs.</li>
<li>Now, obviously, they don’t agree with every idea; they simply do
their best to ensure that all ideas find their way into the open.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in two ways.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>as individuals are exposed to more accurate and relevant
information, they make better choices.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In a very real sense, <i>the Pool of Shared Meaning is a measure
of a group’s IQ.</i></li>
<li><b>The larger the shared pool, the smarter the decisions.</b></li>
<li>And even though many people may be involved in a choice, when
people openly and freely share ideas, the increased time
investment is more than offset by the quality of the decision.</li>
<li>When people purposefully withhold meaning from one another,
individually smart people can do collectively stupid things.</li>
<li>Meaning didn’t flow freely because people were afraid to speak
up.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In every instance where bosses are smart, highly paid,
confident, and outspoken (i.e., most of the world), people
tend to hold back their opinions rather than risk angering
someone in a position of power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As everyone on the team began to explain his or her opinion,
people formed a clearer and more complete picture of the
circumstances.</li>
<li>As they began to understand the whys and wherefores of
different proposals, they built off one another.</li>
<li>As a result of the free flow of meaning, the whole (final
choice) was truly greater than the sum of the original parts.</li>
<li><b>The Pool of Shared Meaning is the birthplace of synergy.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>since the meaning is <i>shared</i>, people willingly act on whatever
decisions they make—with both unity and conviction.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Eventually, they understand why the shared solution is the best
solution, and they’re committed to act.</li>
<li>(People) didn’t buy into their final choice simply because they
were involved; they bought in because they understood.</li>
<li>Conversely, when people aren’t involved, when they sit back
quietly during touchy conversations, they’re rarely committed
to the final decision.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since their ideas remain in their heads and their opinions
never make it into the pool, they end up quietly criticizing
and passively resisting.</li>
<li>Worse still, when others force their ideas into the pool,
people have a harder time accepting the information.</li>
<li>To quote Samuel Butler, “He that complies against his will is
of his own opinion still.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The time you spend up front establishing a shared pool of meaning is
more than paid for by faster, more unified, and more committed
action later on.</li>
<li>We’re simply suggesting that whatever the decision-making method,
the greater the shared meaning in the pool, the better the choice,
the more the unity, and the stronger the conviction—whoever makes
the choice.</li>
<li>Every time we find ourselves arguing, debating, running away, or
otherwise acting in an ineffective way, it’s because we don’t know
how to share meaning.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>sometimes we move to silence.</li>
<li>Sometimes we rely on hints, sarcasm, caustic humor, innuendo, and
looks of disgust to make our points.</li>
<li>On other occasions, not knowing how to stay in dialogue, we try to
force our meaning into the pool.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We act like we know everything, hoping people will believe our
arguments.</li>
<li>We discredit others, hoping people won’t believe their
arguments.</li>
<li>And then we use every manner of force to get our way or possibly
even harm others.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We borrow power from the boss;</li>
<li>we hit people with biased monologues;</li>
<li>we make hurtful comments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The goal, of course, is always the same—to compel others to our
point of view.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our problem is not that our behavior degenerates. It’s that our
motives do—a fact that we usually miss.</li>
<li>So the first step to achieving the results we <i>really</i> want is to
<b>fix the problem of believing that others are the source of all that

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It’s our dogmatic conviction that “if we could just fix those

could lead to dialogue and progress.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org71e6de3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When under attack, our heart can take a similarly sudden and
unconscious turn. When faced with pressure and strong opinions, we
often stop worrying about the goal of adding to the pool of meaning
and start looking for ways to win, punish, or keep the peace.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Winning.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This desire to win is built into our very fiber before we’re old
enough to know what’s going on.</li>
<li>This particular dialogue killer sits at the top of many of our
lists.</li>

<li>Punishing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes, as our anger increases, we move from wanting to win
the point to wanting to harm the other person.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keeping the peace.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes we choose personal safety over dialogue.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org80d6951">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Refocus your brain.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our motives usually change without any conscious thought on our
part.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When adrenaline does our thinking for us, our motives flow with
the chemical tide.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In order to move back to motives that allow for dialogue, you must
step away from the interaction and look at yourself—much like an
outsider.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ask yourself: “What am I doing, and if I had to guess, what does
it tell me about my underlying motive?”</li>
<li>when you name the game, you can stop playing it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stop and ask yourself some questions that return you to dialogue.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do I really want for myself?</li>
<li>What do I really want for others?</li>
<li>What do I really want for the relationship?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once you’ve asked yourself what you want, add one more equally
telling question: How would I behave if I really wanted these
results?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are two good reasons for asking these questions.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the answer to what we really want helps us to locate our own
North Star. (Find your bearings.)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Despite the fact that we’re being tempted to take the wrong
path by (1) people who are trying to pick a fight, (2)
thousands of years of genetic hard wiring that brings our
emotions to a quick boil, and (3) our deeply ingrained habit of
trying to win,</li>
<li>our North Star returns us to our original purpose.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When we ask ourselves what we really want, we affect our entire
physiology. (Take charge of your body.)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As we introduce complex and abstract questions to our mind, the
problem-solving part of our brain recognizes that we are now
dealing with intricate social issues and not physical threats.</li>
<li>When we present our brain with a demanding question, our body
sends precious blood to the parts of our brain that help us
think and away from the parts of our body that help us take
flight or begin a fight.</li>

<h3 id="org8cb68aa">Learn to Look for Safety Problems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8cb68aa">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People who are gifted at dialogue keep a constant vigil on <i>safety</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>they watch for signs that people are becoming fearful.</li>
<li>they immediately turn their attention to whether or not others
feel safe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When it’s safe, you can say anything.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nothing kills the flow of meaning like fear.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you fear that people aren’t buying into your ideas, you
start pushing too hard.</li>
<li>When you fear that you may be harmed in some way, you start
withdrawing and hiding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the other hand, if you make it safe enough,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you can talk about almost anything and people will listen.</li>
<li>you yourself can hear almost anything and not become defensive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>people rarely become defensive simply because of <i>what</i> you’re
saying. <b>They only become defensive when they no longer feel
safe.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The problem is not the <i>content</i> of your message, but the
<i>condition</i> of the conversation.</li>
<li>If you can learn to see when people start to feel unsafe, you
can take action to fix it.</li>
<li>That means the first challenge is to simply <i>see</i> and
<i>understand</i> that safety is at risk.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You felt <i>safe</i> receiving the feedback because you trusted the
motives and ability of the other person.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if you don’t feel safe, you can’t take any
feedback.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you don’t feel safe, even well-intended comments are
suspect.</li>
<li>When it’s unsafe, you start to go blind.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By pulling yourself out of the content of an argument and
looking for signs that safety is a risk, you reengage your
brain and your full vision returns.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t let safety problems lead you astray.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Now, since they’re feeling unsafe, you <i>should</i> be thinking to
yourself: “Hey, they’re feeling unsafe. I need to do
something—maybe make it safer.”
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We’re asking you to recode silence and violence as signs that
people are feeling unsafe.</li>
<li>We’re asking you to fight your natural tendency to respond in
kind.</li>

genetic shaping that prod you to take flight or pick a fight
(when under attack), and recode the stimulus. “Ah, that’s a sign
that the other person feels unsafe.”</li>

from the pool of meaning.</li>
<li>It’s almost always done as a means of avoiding potential
problems,</li>

<li>Methods range from playing verbal games to avoiding a person
entirely.</li>
<li>The three most common forms of silence
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Masking
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>understating or selectively showing our true opinions.</li>

<li>Avoiding
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>steering completely away from sensitive subjects.</li>

dominating the conversation.</li>
<li>Methods include
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>cutting others off,</li>
<li>overstating your facts,</li>
<li>speaking in absolutes,</li>

<h3 id="org0993372">NOTICE WHICH CONDITION IS AT RISK</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0993372">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first step to building safety comes with understanding which of
two different conditions of safety is at risk. Each requires a
different solution.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6ca8842" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6ca8842">Mutual Purpose—the Entrance Condition (Why Talk in the First Place?)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6ca8842">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Crucial conversations often go awry
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>not because others dislike the <i>content</i> of the conversation,</li>
<li>but because they believe the content (even if it’s delivered in a
gentle way) suggests that you have a malicious <i>intent</i>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consequently, the first condition of safety is <i>Mutual Purpose</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mutual Purpose means that others perceive that
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you’re working toward a common outcome in the conversation,</li>
<li>you care about their goals, interests, and values.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find a shared goal, and you have both a good reason and a healthy
climate for talking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Watch for signs that Mutual Purpose is at risk.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, when Mutual Purpose is at risk, we end up in debate.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When others start forcing their opinions into the pool of
meaning, it’s often because they figure that we’re trying to win
and they need to do the same.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other signs that purpose is at risk include
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>defensiveness,</li>
<li>hidden agendas (the silence form of fouled-up purpose),</li>
<li>accusations,</li>
<li>circling back to the same topic.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>two crucial questions to help us determine when Mutual Purpose is at
risk:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do others believe I care about their goals in this conversation?</li>
<li>Do they trust my motives?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remember the <i>Mutual</i> in Mutual Purpose.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To succeed in crucial conversations, we must really care about the
interests of others—not just our own.</li>
<li>Before you begin, examine your motives. Ask yourself the Start
with Heart questions:</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look for the mutuality.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if you <i>try to see the other person’s point of view</i>, you can
often find a way to draw the other person willingly into even very
sensitive conversations.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org8ac734b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8ac734b">Mutual Respect—the Continuance Condition (Will We Be Able to Remain in Dialogue?)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8ac734b">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you can’t stay in the conversation if you don’t maintain <i>Mutual
Respect</i>.</li>
<li>respect is like air.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As long as it’s present, nobody thinks about it.</li>
<li>But if you take it away, it’s all that people can think about.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To spot when respect is violated and safety takes a turn south,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>watch for signs that people are defending their dignity.</li>
<li>Emotions are the key.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When people feel disrespected, they become highly charged.</li>
<li>Their emotions turn from fear to anger.</li>
<li>Then they resort to pouting, name-calling, yelling, and making
threats.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ask the following question to determine when Mutual Respect is at

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do others believe I respect them?</li>

<li><a id="org448f1b9"></a>Can You Respect People You Don’t Respect?<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org448f1b9">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dialogue truly would be doomed if we had to share every objective or
respect every element of another person’s character before we could
talk.</li>
<li>we can stay in dialogue by <b>finding a way to honor and regard
another person’s basic humanity</b>.</li>
<li>In essence, feelings of disrespect often come when we dwell on how
others are <i>different</i> from ourselves.</li>
<li>We can counteract these feelings by looking for ways we are similar.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
When we recognize that we all have weaknesses, it’s easier to find
a way to respect others.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Lord, help me forgive those who sin differently than I.”
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>When we do this, we feel a kinship or mutuality between ourselves
and even the thorniest of people.</li>
<li>This sense of kinship and connection to others helps create Mutual
Respect and eventually enables us to stay in dialogue with
virtually anyone.</li>

<h3 id="org75d1fef">WHAT TO DO ONCE YOU STEP OUT</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org75d1fef">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>three hard-hitting skills that the best at dialogue use:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Apologize When Appropriate
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start with an apology
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An apology is a statement that sincerely expresses your sorrow
for your role in causing—or at least not preventing—pain or
difficulty to others.</li>
<li>An apology isn’t really an apology unless you experience a
change in heart
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to change.</li>
<li><b>You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning in
order to focus on what you <i>really</i> want</b></li>
<li>You have to sacrifice a bit of your ego by admitting your
error.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But like many sacrifices, when you give up something you value,
you’re rewarded with something even more valuable
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>healthy dialogue</li>
<li>better results.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next, watch to see if this sincere show of respect has helped
restore safety.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If it has, you can now explain the details of what happened.</li>
<li>If it hasn’t, you’ll need to use one of the more advanced
skills.</li>
<li>In any case, first make it safe; then return to the issue.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><a id="orge221817"></a> to Fix Misunderstanding
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent,
step out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill
called <i>Contrasting</i>.</li>
<li><p>
Contrasting is a don’t/do statement that:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>the don’t part</dt><dd>Addresses others’ concerns that you don’t
respect them or that you have a malicious
purpose.</dd>
<dt>the do part</dt><dd>Confirms your respect or clarifies your real
purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="example">
[The don’t part] “The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I
don’t value the work you put in or that I didn’t want to share it with
the VP.
[The do part] I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular.”
</pre></li>
<li>Of the two parts of Contrasting, the <i>don’t</i> is the more
important because it deals with the misunderstanding that has
put safety at risk.</li>
<li><i>Contrasting is not apologizing.</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is not a way of taking back something we’ve said that hurt
others’ feelings.</li>
<li>it is a way of ensuring that what we said didn’t hurt more
than it should have.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Contrasting provides context and proportion</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you’re in the middle of a touchy conversation, sometimes
others experience your words as bigger or worse than you
intend.</li>
<li><p>
If this belief is incorrect, use Contrasting to clarify what
you don’t and do believe.
</p>
<pre class="example">
“Let me put this in perspective. I don’t want you to think I’m not
satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to continue working
together. I really do think you’re doing a good job. This punctuality
issue is important to me, and I’d just like you to work on that. If
you will be more attentive to that, there are no other issues.”
</pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Use Contrasting for prevention or first aid</i>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>prevention</dt><dd>When we’re aware that something we’re about to
drop into the pool of meaning could create a
splash of defensiveness, we use Contrasting to
bolster safety—before we see others going to
either silence or violence.</dd>
<dt>first aid</dt><dd>When people misunderstand and you start arguing
over the misunderstanding, stop. Use
Contrasting. Explain what you don’t mean until
you’ve restored safety. Then return to the
conversation. Safety first.</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a Mutual Purpose
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <i>worst</i> at dialogue
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>opt for
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>competition</dt><dd>either ignore the problem and push ahead</dd>
<dt>submission</dt><dd>or roll over and let others have their way</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Both strategies end up making winners and losers, and the
problem continues long beyond the initial conversation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <i>good</i> at dialogue
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>move immediately toward compromise</li>
<li>While compromise is sometimes necessary, the best know better
than to start there.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <i>best</i> at dialogue
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use four skills to create a Mutual Purpose (CRIB)
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Commit to Seek Mutual Purpose
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Start with Heart - How to Stay Focused on What You Really Want</i></li>
<li>In this case, you have to <i>agree to agree</i></li>
<li>We Start with Heart by committing to stay in the
conversation <i>until we invent a solution that serves a
purpose we both share.</i></li>
<li>This can be tough. To stop arguing, we have to
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>suspend our belief that our choice is the absolute
best and only one, and that we’ll never be happy
until we get exactly what we currently want.</li>
<li>open our mind to the fact that maybe, just maybe,
there is a third choice out there—one that suits
everyone.</li>
<li>be willing to verbalize this commitment even when our
partner seems committed to winning</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<pre class="example">
“It seems like we’re both trying to force our view on each other. I
commit to stay in this discussion until we have a solution that
satisfies both of us.”
</pre></li>
<li>Recognize the Purpose Behind the Strategy
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We confuse wants or purpose with strategies
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We think we'll never find a way out because <i>we equate
what we're asking for with what we actually want</i></li>
<li>In truth, what we’re asking for is the <i>strategy</i>
we’re suggesting to get what we want.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Before you can agree on a Mutual Purpose, you must first
know what people’s real purposes are.</li>
<li>When you do separate strategies from purpose, new
options become possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Invent a Mutual Purpose
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you cannot <i>discover</i> a Mutual Purpose, you'll have
to actively <i>invent</i> one</li>
<li>To invent a Mutual Purpose, move to more encompassing
goals.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Find an objective that is more meaningful or more
rewarding than the ones that divide the various sides</li>
<li>By <b>focusing on higher and longer-term goals</b>, you
often find ways to transcend short-term compromises,
build Mutual Purpose, and return to dialogue.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Brainstorm New Strategies
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you’ve committed to finding something everyone can
support and surfaced what you really want,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you’ll no longer be spending your energy on
unproductive conflict.</li>
<li>Instead, you’ll be actively coming up with options
that can serve everyone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you’re not willing to give creativity a try, it’ll be
impossible for you to jointly come up with a mutually
acceptable option. If you are, the sky’s the limit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>BUT I COULD NEVER DO THAT!
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don’t overwhelm yourself by insisting that you think and act this
clearly and professionally during every heated and emotional
conversation.</li>
<li>Merely consider whether you could think a little more clearly
during a few crucial conversations.</li>
<li>Remember, <b>when it comes to these high-stakes conversations, a
little progress can produce a lot of benefit.</b></li>
<li>Finally, as is the case with most complicated problems, <b>don’t aim
for perfection. Aim for progress.</b></li>

<li>You and only you create your emotions.

<li>Emotions don’t settle upon you like a fog.</li>
<li>They are not foisted upon you by others.</li>

<li>Once you’ve created your upset emotions, you have only two
options:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>act on them (find a way to master them)</li>
<li>be acted on by them (fall hostage to them)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The <i>worst</i> at dialogue fall into the trap that their emotions and
behavior are the only right and reasonable reactions under the
circumstances.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The worst at dialogue fall hostage to their emotions,</li>
<li>and they don’t even know it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <i>good</i> at dialogue realize that if they don’t control their
emotions, matters will get worse.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So they try something else.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They fake it.</li>
<li>They choke down reactions and then do their best to get back to
dialogue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unfortunately, once these emotionally choked folks hit a rough
spot in a crucial conversation, their suppressed emotions come out
of hiding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <i>best</i> at dialogue do something completely different. they <i>act</i>
on their emotions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>when they have strong feelings, they influence (and often change)
their emotions by <i>thinking them out</i>.</li>
<li>As a result, they choose their emotions, and by so doing, make it
possible to choose behaviors that create better results.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As it turns out, there <i>is</i> an intermediate step between what others
do and how we feel.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>because actions themselves can’t and don’t cause emotional
reactions.</li>
<li>That’s why, when faced with the exact same circumstances, ten
people may have ten different emotional responses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is this intermediate step?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Just <i>after</i> we observe what others do and just <i>before</i> we feel
some emotion about it, we tell ourselves a story.</li>
<li>We add meaning to the action we observed.</li>
<li>We make a guess at the motive driving the behavior.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why were they doing that?</li>
<li>We also add judgment—is that good or bad?</li>

<li>And then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds
with an emotion.</li>

of our own emotions by telling a different story.

<blockquote>
<p>
Nothing in this world is good or bad, but thinking makes it
so.—WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stories provide our rationale for what’s going on.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They’re our interpretations of the facts.</li>
<li>They help explain what we see and hear.</li>
<li>They’re theories we use to explain <i>why</i>, <i>how</i>, and <i>what</i>.</li>
<li>our emotions are directly linked to our judgments of right/wrong,
good/bad, kind/selfish, fair/unfair, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even if you don’t realize it, you are telling yourself stories.
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>You may not remember it, but you tell a story.</li>

<li>Any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of stories.</li>

<h3 id="org530c5fa">SKILLS FOR MASTERING OUR STORIES</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org530c5fa">
<p>
The best at dialogue find a way to first slow down and then take
charge of their Path to Action.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Retrace Your Path
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First you have to stop what you’re currently doing. Then you have
to get in touch with why you’re doing it.</li>
<li>How
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>[Act] Notice your behavior.
Am I in some form of silence or violence?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>looking isn’t enough. You must take an <i>honest</i> look at what
you’re doing.</li>
<li>When an unhelpful story is driving you to silence or
violence, stop and consider how others would see your
actions.</li>
<li>Not only do those who are best at crucial conversations
notice when they’re slipping into silence or violence, but
they’re also able to admit it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They don’t wallow in self-doubt, of course,</li>
<li>but they do recognize the problem and begin to take
corrective action.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>[Feel] Get in touch with your feelings.
What emotions are encouraging me to act this way?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>identifying your emotions is more difficult than you might
imagine.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Knowing what you’re really feeling helps you take a more
accurate look at what is going on and why.</li>
<li>When experiencing strong emotions,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>do you stop and think about your feelings? If so, do you
use a rich vocabulary？</li>
<li>do you talk openly with others about how you feel? Do you
willingly talk with loved ones about what’s going on inside
of you?</li>
<li>in so doing, is your vocabulary robust and accurate?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>[Tell story] Analyze your stories.
What story is creating these emotions?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Question your feelings and stories.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first step to regaining emotional control is to
challenge the illusion that what you’re feeling is the only
right emotion under the circumstances.</li>
<li>By questioning our feelings, we open ourselves up to
question our stories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t confuse stories with facts.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You confuse subjective conclusions with steel-hard data
points.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The facts could mean just about anything.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[See/hear] Get back to the facts.
What evidence do I have to support this story?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Separate fact from story by focusing on behavior.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Test your ideas against a simple criterion:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can you <i>see</i> or <i>hear</i> this thing you’re calling a fact?</li>
<li>Was it an actual behavior?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spot the story by watching for “hot” words.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They express judgments and attributions that, in turn,
create strong emotions.</li>
<li>They are story, not fact.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>By retracing your path one element at a time, you put yourself in
a position to think about, question, and change any one or more
of the elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Watch for Three “Clever” Stories
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>with time and experience we become quite good at coming up with
explanations that serve us well.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Either our stories are completely accurate and propel us in
healthy directions,</li>
<li>or they’re quite inaccurate but justify our current
behavior—making us feel good about ourselves and calling for no
need to change.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We call these imaginative and self-serving concoctions “clever
stories.”
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They’re clever because they allow us to feel good about
behaving badly.</li>
<li>Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly
even while achieving abysmal results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we tend to tell our stories in three very predictable ways.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org8ea6e94"></a>—“It’s Not My Fault”
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The theme is always the same.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The other person is bad, wrong, or dumb, and we are good,
right, or brilliant.</li>
<li>Other people do bad or stupid things, and we suffer as a
result.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Within most crucial conversations, when you tell a Victim
Story,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you intentionally ignore the role you have played in the
problem.</li>
<li>You tell your story in a way that judiciously avoids
whatever <i>you</i> have done (or neglected to do) that might
have contributed to the problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To help support your Victim Stories you speak of nothing but
your noble motives.</li>
<li>Then you tell yourself that you’re being punished for your
virtues, not your vices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a id="org3c84169"></a>—“It’s All Your Fault”
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In Villain Stories we overemphasize the other person’s guilt
or stupidity.</li>
<li>We automatically assume the worst possible motives or
grossest incompetence while ignoring any possible good or
neutral intentions or skills a person may have.</li>
<li>Labeling is a common device in Villain Stories.</li>
<li>Not only do Villain Stories help us blame others for bad
results, but they also set us up to then do whatever we want
to the “villains.”
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After all, we can feel okay insulting or abusing a
bonehead—whereas we might have to be more careful with a
living, breathing person.</li>
<li>Then when we fail to get the results we really want, we
stay stuck in our ineffective behavior because, after all,
look who we’re dealing with!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Watch for the double standard.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we make mistakes, we tell a Victim Story by claiming
our intentions were innocent and pure.</li>
<li>On the other hand, when others do things that hurt or
inconvenience us, we tell Villain Stories in which we
<i>invent</i> terrible motives or exaggerate flaws for others
based on how their actions affected us.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a id="orgf3b12b6"></a>—“There’s Nothing Else I Can Do”
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In these fabrications we make ourselves out to be powerless
to do anything healthy or helpful.</li>
<li>We convince ourselves that there are no healthy alternatives
for dealing with our predicament, which justifies the action
we’re about to take.</li>
<li>While Villian and Victim Stories look back to explain why
we’re in the situation we’re in, Helpless Stories look
forward to explain why we can’t do anything to change our
situation.</li>
<li>It’s particularly easy to act helpless when we turn others’
behavior into fixed and unchangeable traits.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Helpless Stories often stem from Villain Stories and
typically offer us nothing more than Fool’s Choices</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Why We Tell Clever Stories
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Clever stories match reality.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes the stories we tell are accurate.</li>
<li>It’s not common, but it can happen.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clever stories get us off the hook.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>they conveniently excuse us from any responsibility—when, in
reality, we have been partially responsible.</li>
<li>However, if we can make others out as wrong and ourselves out
as right, we’re off the hook.</li>
<li>Better yet, once we’ve demonized others, we can even insult
and abuse them if we want.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clever stories keep us from acknowledging our own sellouts.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our need to tell clever stories often starts with our own
sellouts.</li>
<li>we usually don’t begin telling stories that justify our
actions until we have done something that we feel a need to
justify.1</li>
<li>We sell out when we consciously act against our own sense of
what’s right.</li>
<li>And after we’ve sold out, we have only two choices:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>own up to our sellout,</li>
<li>try to justify it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>if we don’t admit to our errors, we inevitably look for ways
to justify them.</li>
<li>You didn’t start telling clever stories until <i>after</i> you
failed to do something you knew you should have done.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You got upset because you sold out.</li>
<li>And the clever story helped you feel good about being rude.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sellouts are often not big events.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In fact, they can be so small that they’re easy for us to
overlook when we’re crafting our clever stories.</li>
<li>Here are some common ones:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You believe you should help someone, but don’t.</li>
<li>You believe you should apologize, but don’t.</li>
<li>You believe you should stay late to finish up on a
commitment, but go home instead.</li>
<li>You say yes when you know you should say no, then hope no
one follows up to see if you keep your commitment.</li>
<li>You believe you should talk to someone about concerns you
have with him or her, but don’t.</li>
<li>You do less than your share and think you should
acknowledge it, but say nothing knowing no one else will
bring it up either.</li>
<li>You believe you should listen respectfully to feedback,
but become defensive instead.</li>
<li>You see problems with a plan someone presents and think
you should speak up, but don’t.</li>
<li>You fail to complete an assignment on time and believe
you should let others know, but don’t.</li>
<li>You know you have information a coworker could use, but
keep it to yourself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even small sellouts like these get us started telling clever
stories.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we don’t admit to our own mistakes, we obsess about
others’ faults, our innocence, and our powerlessness to
do anything other than what we’re already doing.</li>
<li><b>We tell a clever story when we want self-justification
more than results.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Of course, self-justification is not what we really want,</li>
<li>but we certainly act as if it is.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tell the Rest of the Story
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The dialogue-smart recognize that they’re telling clever stories,
stop, and then do what it takes to tell a useful story.</li>
<li>A useful story, by definition, creates emotions that lead to
healthy action—such as dialogue.</li>
<li>What transforms a clever story into a useful one? The rest of the
story.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That’s because clever stories have one characteristic in
common: They’re incomplete.</li>
<li>Clever stories omit crucial information
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>about us,</li>
<li>about others,</li>
<li>about our options.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Only by including all of these essential details can clever
stories be transformed into useful ones.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What’s the best way to fill in the missing details? Quite simply,
it’s done by turning victims into actors, villains into humans,
and the helpless into the able.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Turn victims into actors.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ask:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Am I pretending not to notice my role in the problem?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maybe, just maybe, you did something to help cause the
problem.</li>
<li>Instead of being a victim, you were an actor.</li>
<li>By asking what role you’ve played, you begin to realize how
selective your perception has been.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a id="org31c901e"></a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ask:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do
what this person is doing?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This particular question humanizes others.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As we search for plausible answers to it, our emotions
soften.</li>
<li>Empathy often replaces judgment,</li>
<li>and depending upon how we’ve treated others, personal
accountability replaces self-justification.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The purpose of the humanizing question is to deal with our
own stories and emotions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It provides us with still another tool for working on
ourselves first by providing a variety of possible reasons
for the other person’s behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In fact, with experience and maturity we learn to worry less
about others’ intent and more about the <i>effect</i> others’
actions are having on us.</li>
<li>When we reflect on alternative motives, not only do we soften
our emotions, but equally important, we relax our absolute
certainty long enough to allow for dialogue—the only reliable
way of discovering others’ genuine motives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Turn the helpless into the able.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ask:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do I really want? For me? For others? For the
relationship?</li>
<li>What would I do right now if I really wanted these results?
(To kill the Fool's Choice)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What should you be doing instead? Openly, honestly, and
effectively discussing the problem—not taking potshots and
then justifying yourself.</li>
<li>When you refuse to make yourself helpless, you’re forced to
hold yourself accountable for using your dialogue skills
rather than bemoaning your weakness.</li>

<li><b>Starting with our ugly stories is the most controversial, least
influential, and most insulting way we could begin</b></li>
<li>To make matters worse, this strategy creates still another
self-fulfilling prophecy:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We’re so anxious to blurt out our unflattering conclusions that
we say things in extremely ineffective ways.</li>
<li>Then, when we get bad results (and we <i>are</i> going to get bad

views without creating problems.</li>
<li>So the next time we've got something sticky to say, we're even
more reluctant to say it.</li>
<li>When we do eventually share our horrific story, we do so with a
vengeance</li>

<li><i>Facts are the least controversial</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Facts provide a safe beginning</li>
<li>By their very nature, facts aren't controversial</li>
<li>Conclusions, on the other hand, are highly controversial</li>
<li>Eventually we may want to share our conclusions, but we certainly

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Don't start with your stories. <b>Start with your observations.</b></li>

<h4 id="orge29ee16">THE "HOW" SKILLS (tell <i>how</i> to do it)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge29ee16">
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org7b75f58"></a>Talk Tentatively<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org7b75f58">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Talking tentatively simply means that <b>we tell our story as a story
rather than disguising it as a hard fact</b></li>
<li>When sharing a story, strike a blend between confidence and
humility.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Share in a way
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>that expresses appropriate confidence in your conclusions</li>
<li>while demonstrating that, if called for, you want your
conclusions challenged</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To do so
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>change “The fact is” to “In my opinion.”</li>
<li>Swap “Everyone knows that” for “I’ve talked to three of our
suppliers who think that.”</li>
<li>Soften “It’s clear to me” to “I’m beginning to wonder if.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why soften the message?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because we’re trying to add meaning to the pool, not force it down
other people’s throats</li>
<li>If we’re too forceful, the information won’t make it into the
pool.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One of the ironies of dialogue is that, when talking with those
holding opposing opinions, <b>the more convinced and forceful you
act, the more resistant others become.</b></li>
<li>Speaking in absolute and overstated terms does not increase your
influence, it decreases it.</li>
<li>The more tentatively you speak, the more open people become to
your opinions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If being tentative is akin to being manipulative. You’re
“pretending” to be uncertain about your opinion in order to help
others consider it less defensively.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you are faking tentativeness, you are not in dialogue.</li>
<li>The reason we should speak tentatively is because we, <i>indeed</i>,
are not certain that our opinions represent absolute truth or our
understanding of the facts is complete and perfect.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You should never pretend to be less confident than you are.</li>
<li>But likewise, you should not pretend to be more confident than
your limited capacity allows.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Tentative, not wimpy</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you begin with a complete disclaimer and do it in a tone that
suggests you’re consumed with doubt, you do the message a
disservice.</li>
<li>It’s one thing to be humble and open. It’s quite another to be
clinically uncertain.</li>
<li><b>Use language that says you’re sharing an opinion</b>, not language
that says you’re a nervous wreck.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgbe59148">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Others need to feel safe sharing their observations and
stories—particularly if they differ from yours.</li>
<li>Otherwise, they don’t speak up and you can’t test the accuracy and
relevance of your views.</li>
<li>Safety becomes particularly important when you’re having a crucial
conversation with people who might move to silence.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some people make Fool’s Choices in these circumstances. They worry
that if they share their true opinions, others will clam up.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So they choose between
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>speaking their minds</li>
<li>hearing others out</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>But the <i>best</i> at dialogue don’t choose. <b>They do both.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the only limit to how strongly you can express your opinion is
your willingness to be equally vigorous in encouraging others to
challenge it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Invite opposing views</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you think others may be hesitant, make it clear that you want
to hear their views—no matter how different</li>
<li>If what they have to say is controversial or even touchy, respect
them for finding the courage to express what they’re thinking.</li>
<li>If they have different facts or stories, you need to hear them to
help complete the picture.</li>
<li>Make sure they have the opportunity to share by actively inviting
them to do so:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>“Does anyone see it differently?”</li>
<li>“What am I missing here?”</li>
<li>“I’d really like to hear the other side of this story.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Mean it</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don’t turn an invitation into a veiled threat.</li>
<li>Invite people with both words and tone that say, “I really want to
hear from you.”
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>“I know people have been reluctant to speak up about this, but I
would really love to hear from everyone.”</li>
<li>“I know there are at least two sides to this story. Could we
hear differing views now? What problems could this decision
cause us?”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Play devil's advocate</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Occasionally you can tell that others are not buying into your
facts or story, but they’re not speaking up either.</li>
<li><p>
Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view.
</p>
<pre class="example">
“Maybe I’m wrong here. What if the opposite is true? What if the
reason sales have dropped is because . . .”

</ul></li>
<li><i>Do it until your motive becomes obvious</i>

them feeling the way they’re feeling.</b></li>
<li>So as we describe what we see, we have to do so calmly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples of mirroring include:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>“You say you’re okay, but by the tone of your voice, you seem
upset.”</li>
<li>“You seem angry at me.”</li>
<li>“You look nervous about confronting him. Are you sure you’re
willing to do it?”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Paraphrase to Acknowledge the Story
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you get a clue about <i>why</i> the person is feeling as he or she
does, you can build additional safety by paraphrasing what you’ve
heard.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be careful not to simply parrot back what was said.</li>
<li>Instead, put the message in your own words—usually in an
abbreviated form.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The key to paraphrasing, as with mirroring, is to <b>remain calm and
collected.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stay focused on figuring out how a reasonable, rational, and
decent person could have created this Path to Action. This will
help you keep from becoming angry or defensive.</li>
<li>Simply rephrase what the person has said, and do it in a way
that suggests that it’s okay, you’re trying to understand, and
it’s safe for him or her to talk candidly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Don't push too hard</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The person is still upset, but isn’t explaining his or her
stories or facts. <i>At this point, we may want to back off.</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After a while, our attempts to make it safe for others can
start feeling as if we’re pestering or prying.</li>
<li>If we push too hard, we violate both purpose and respect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rather than trying to get to the source of the other person’s
emotions, we
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>either gracefully exit</li>
<li>or ask what he or she wants to see happen.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Asking people what they want helps them engage their brains
in a way that moves to problem solving and away from either
attacking or avoiding.</li>
<li>It also helps reveal what they think the cause of the
problem is.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prime When You're Getting Nowhere
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prime when you believe that the other person still has something
to share and might do so with a little more effort on your part.</li>
<li>The power-listening term “priming” comes from the expression
“priming the pump.”
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With a pump, you often have to pour some water into it to get it
running.</li>
<li>When it comes to power listening, <b>sometimes you have to offer
your best guess</b> at what the other person is thinking or feeling
before you can expect him or her to do the same.</li>
<li><b>You have to pour some meaning into the pool before the other
person will respond in kind.</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is not the kind of thing you would do unless nothing else has
worked.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You really want to hear from others, and you have a very strong
idea of what they’re probably thinking.</li>
<li>Priming is an act of good faith, taking risks, becoming
vulnerable, and building safety in hopes that others will share
their meaning.</li>

These four options represent increasing degrees of involvement.

<li>Command

<li>Outside forces place demands on us
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With command decisions, it’s not our job to decide what to

<li>It’s our job to decide how to make it work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We turn decisions over to others and then follow their lead
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we decide
<ol class="org-ol">

<li>or that we completely trust the ability of the delegate

</ol></li>
<li>More involvement adds nothing.</li>
<li>In strong teams and great relationships, many decisions are
made by turning the final choice over to someone we trust to
make a good decision.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consult

<li>decision makers invite others to influence them before they make
their choice.</li>

<li>Four Important Questions
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Who cares?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Determine who genuinely wants to be involved in the decision
along with those who will be affected</li>
<li>Don’t involve people who don’t care.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Who knows?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify who has the expertise you need to make the best
decision</li>
<li>Try not to involve people who contribute no new information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Who must agree?

<li>Think of those whose cooperation you might need in the form of
authority or influence in any decisions you might make.</li>
<li>It’s better to involve these people than to surprise them and
then suffer their open resistance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How many people is it worth involving?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your goal should be to <i>involve the fewest number of people</i>
while <i>still considering the quality of the decision along with
the support that people will give it</i>.</li>

<li>Your challenge here is to build safety by establishing a

be willing to take part.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Share what you think the consequences of having or not having
this conversation could be (both positive and negative).</li>

<li>We teach that “when it matters most, we often do our worst.” I’ve
learned that <b>sometimes when it hardly matters at all, we can do
our worst.</b></li>
<li><b>We have to find and ask the right question to get the right
solution.</b></li>
<li>Crucial conversations belong to the first person to see them. I
don’t solve the issues; I just make sure they are brought up in a
safe way.</li>

crucial conversations.</li>

<li>I have become more and more aware of
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>how <i>true</i> emotions can feel during crucial moments</li>
<li>how <i>false</i> they really are</li>

<li>how much these emotions can corrupt my view of those closest to me
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When I am in the grip of Victim, Villain, and Helpless Stories,
when my motives degenerate and I am driven by a desperate need to
be right—I don’t see others as they really are.</li>
<li>Even my precious son can look like a monster.</li>

<li>Our emotions are incredibly plastic.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In crucial moments they are almost always wrong.</li>
<li>With practice, we can gain incredible power to change them.</li>
<li>And as we change them, not only do we learn to change how we see
those around us, but we learn to change our very lives as well.</li>

<li>If you do everything we tell you to do in this book, exactly the way
we tell you to do it, <i>and the other person doesn’t want to
dialogue, dialogue will not take place.</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>The other person has the ability to choose how to respond to your
efforts.</b></li>
<li>These skills are not techniques for controlling others; they are
not tools for manipulating behavior or eliminating others’ agency.</li>
<li>These skills have limits and do not guarantee that other people
will behave in exactly the way you desire.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The title of the book is Crucial Conversations; “conversations” is
plural, meaning many, not one.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The temptation is to think of a crucial conversation as “my one
chance to solve this problem” or as “the one conversation needed
to save a relationship” or as “the one opportunity to make
everything right.”</li>
<li><b>See the single crucial conversation as the beginning of a
dialogue</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the first step toward making a negative relationship positive,</li>
<li>the first of many steps necessary to right a wrong</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Seek to have not just a conversation based on Mutual Purpose and
Mutual Respect, but rather a rich relationship based on these
conditions</li>
<li>To see these principles and skills as ways of building
relationships, teams, and families over time is to <b>take a
longer-term perspective.</b></li>
<li>The wisest use of these skills is to <b>develop habits, lives, and
loves</b>, not to use them just occasionally in single interactions.</li>
<li>Consistently applied principles can have a strong influence over
time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you use these skills exactly the way we tell you to and the other
person doesn’t want to dialogue, you won’t get to dialogue. However,
if you persist over time, refusing to take offense, making your
motive genuine, showing respect, and constantly searching for Mutual
Purpose, then the other person will almost always join you in
dialogue.</li>
