<ul class="org-ul">
<li>努力只是成功的必要条件之一。</li>
<li>这种诉求其实就是一种只要使力只要拼命了就可以成功的心理诉求，
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>因为这类人基本上都是能力有限，不知道怎么提升自己的人，当他们看到只要拼命使力就可以成功的观点时，他们就会有共鸣，就会感到，不用学习那些晦涩难懂高级的知识，不用掌握和练习哪些高级技能，自己只需要在低级的事情上拼命和努力，加更多的班和干更多活，自己就会像电影中的那些小人物一样，总有一天会成功的……</li>
<li>不但符合那些低级管理者的利益诉求，同样符合那些能力不足不愿意学习和成长的人的诉求。因为，他们混淆了行动与进展，忙碌与多产，他们以为能靠蛮力可以弥补思维上的惰性，靠拼命可以弥补能力上的不足……</li>
</ul></li>
<li>当一件事的难度超过一定程度的时候，那些聪明的人会找到更省力的方法，而能力上有问题的，还是在那使蛮力。</li>
<li>我的职业生涯的成长， <b>最根本的不是你有多努力，有多勤奋，而是你能搞定很多人搞不定的事！</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>而我失败的时候，总是因为我搞不定事，即便是加班拼命努力也无济于事！</li>
<li>再回想一下我以前在职场上的很多关键点，不是因为我加班了，而是因为在某些关键问题上，我跳出来解决了其它人都解决不了的问题</li>
</ul></li>
<li>同样是一个简单的 for-loop 语句，有人写的就值 1 万元一行，而你写的则一文不值。关键不在于谁写的代码多，关键在于我们解决了什么样的问题。</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgad254e3">
<p>
I'm trying to use OKRs in my current company recently. But I didn't
know exactly how to do it after reading <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/05/07/clippings-from-measure-what-matters/">Measure What Matters</a>. This
article helped a lot by providing a real world example at Swipely.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
There is no silver bullet. Not in the development world, not in the
management world.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Just because a system’s worked like gangbusters before, doesn’t mean
one size fits all. <b>You have to figure out how to put OKRs to work
for you.</b></li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
The purpose of implement OKRs is to talk about <b>the purpose</b>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The right way to look at OKRs is <b>a way to communicate so there's
clarity of purpose</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At Swipely, (personal) OKRs are made up of
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>a high level objective</li>
<li>a more detailed description of why that objective is important</li>
<li>a summary of how the objective aligns with the broader goals of
both the person's team and the company
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When personal objectives are directly and clearly connected
to the broader goals of the company, they're suddenly more
inspiring, less myopic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the three to five key results that will help them achieve that
goal</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Having public goals forces different types of thinking around how
people ask for help from others
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>everyone can see what's on their co-workers' plates and
employees no longer feel like they're toiling in a vacuum, or
for their manager's approval</li>
<li>That way, OKRs become a built-in way for people to
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>ask for resources,</li>
<li>easily spot where they can come to their colleagues' aid</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>

Examples
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Paul, a member of Swipely’s engineering team
</p>
<pre class="example">
Objective: Ship [X] feature to increase engagement.

Description: Our [X] will allow merchants to access Swipely anywhere,
increasing engagement, value and differentiation which will reduce
churn and differentiate our offering with an exciting new value
proposition.

Alignment: A company-wide objective is to “Become a ‘must-have’ tool
merchants love to use,” which has a key result, “Ship [X] product to
increase engagement and drive excitement in sale.” The individual
objective to ship [X] is aligned with this company-wide objective.

Key Results:

    Deliver alpha version to targeted devices for alpha testing
    feedback from 10 early customers by [date: mm/dd/yyyy].

    Provide screenshots/screencast to support marketing launch of the
    app by [date: mm/dd/yyyy].

    Release beta version by [date: mm/dd/yyyy].

    Achieve engagement DAU / MAU metric of [X] with beta audience.
</pre></li>
<li><p>
Cindy, a sales account executive who wants to turn more dials
into demos.
</p>
<pre class="example">
Objective: Develop better prospecting skills.

Description: By improving prospecting skills, I will get into more
initial presentations and win more business!

Alignment: A company-wide objective is to “accelerate revenue growth,”
which has a key result, “grow booked ARR by $XX to $YY mm, thanks to
new AEs, channel, and fully ramped AEs.” The individual objective to
improve prospecting skills is aligned with this company-wide objective
because it will help Cindy attain her quota targets. It also aligns
with a company-wide objective to strengthen the team.

Key Results:

    Review training materials from our online coaching resource.

    Do 2 60-minute game tape reviews with the sales manager, reviewing
    20+ prospecting calls for coaching on what’s working, what’s not
    working.

    Do a role-playing session with Allie, who has our team’s top
    connect-to-meeting rate.

    Test 5 new “compelling reason” pitches on prospecting calls to
    introduce humor, rapport and other techniques.

    Increase my weekly connect-to-meeting rate from X% to Y%.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbfa25e9">
<p>
This article resonated with my experience of fighting
procrastination so well. The only way to fight procrastination is to
start doing things poorly.
</p>

<p>
And I think it can also relate to <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2019/05/16/defining-a-mvp-by-setting-okrs/">the idea of MVP</a>: a MVP is how a
product is doing poorly. So MVP can help you validate your idea. If
your product is worth doing, then the MVP would be worth doing, and
you can see that by the feedback from its user.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>When it comes to implementing an idea, things that are worth doing
are worth doing poorly.</b></li>
<li>Why many things don't get done at all because the concern for
perfection trumps the practice of "just do it?"

<li>Overthinking</li>

<li>Self-criticism</li>

<li>Clarity comes from action, not thinking</li>
<li>Creativity flows when you don't block it</li>

I'm glad that I'm already doing some of the things mentioned in this
article. For example: this <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/">Clipping</a> section is exactly how I make my
<b>curations</b>.
</p>

<p>
And I learned that I need to <b>share my ideas</b> more often. For now, I
only keep a list of ideas in my local and never share them with others
before I finish a blog post. From now on, I'll share these ideas with
my friends and also on Twitter.
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A way to "bootstrap" your way to an audience: <b>curation</b>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>The Thought Leader Strategy</dt><dd>curate a summary of your favorite thought leader's
best work.</dd>
<dt>The Idea Strategy</dt><dd>pick an idea you're interested in and curate a list
of the best resources on the topic.</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><b>Listen to feedback</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Test your ideas out on intelligent friends, and don’t
be afraid to state the obvious.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If an idea consistently surprises somebody, it’s
probably good,</li>
<li>but if people look bored or confused when you’re
sharing an idea, you should either drop it or
communicate the idea differently.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many writers wait until they publish a blog post to
share an idea with somebody. I do the opposite. I
<b>share my ideas as much as I can</b> and run them through
numerous filters.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>conversations</li>
<li>tweets</li>
<li>emails</li>
<li>blog posts</li>
</ol></li>
<li>With it, we had instant access to more wisdom,
experience, perspective, and diversity, in one minute
than we could have gained in a hundred lifetimes.</li>
