            <h1>How to do Code Review correctly</h1>
            <p>
Last week, I posted this post about my <a href="http://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2017/10/26/thoughts-on-implementing-a-strong-code-review-culture/">Thoughts on "Implementing a
Strong Code-Review Culture"</a>.
</p>

<p>
After that, I shared this talk with my whole team and it was a great
success: everyone got interested in code review and wanted to do more
reviews in their daily work. But a question raised up pretty quickly:
How to do Code Review correctly. (I cut this part out to keep my
sharing short and just to lure people into the world of Code Review).
</p>

<p>
So, in this post, I'll explain my current understanding of how to do
Code Review correctly and efficiently.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3bec44e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3bec44e">Always submit a merge request for review</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3bec44e">
<p>
No matter you are senior or junior, you can always learn something
from code review.
</p>

<p>
No matter your code is a new feature or a hotfix, it can always be
better after being reviewed.
</p>

<p>
So, always send a merge request for a new change and assign it to
someone to review it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6fa36b8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6fa36b8">Keep your build passing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6fa36b8">
<p>
Though the goal is code discussing, it's still important to keep your
build passing.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>as the author</b>, you need to do following things before you send the
MR link to your peer:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make sure all the new features in this merge request are covered
by tests.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Write integration test (e.g. use Capybara) for the new feature
(at least cover the happy path)</li>
<li>Write unit test to test your models, controllers, services, and
even views</li>
<li>Attach screenshot for features that's hard to test using Capybara</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make sure style checkers are passing (rubocops, stylelint, eslint)</li>
<li>Make sure CI pipeline is passing</li>
</ol></li>
<li><b>As the reviewer</b>, you need to do following things:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make sure CI pipeline is passing (If not, notify the author and
fix it together)</li>
<li>Check if all the new features are covered by test cases</li>
<li>You should be able to NOT check styles in a merge request because
the style checker in your CI pipeline covers it for you (If it's
not the case, update your CI settings)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1f90aef" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1f90aef">What if CI is failing for something else</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1f90aef">
<p>
For example, due to a third API failure, CI failed because of a
non-related test.
</p>

<p>
Same solution: <b>DISCUSS</b> it with your reviewer/author.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try to find a way to fix it
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Wrap the third party API in a new class</li>
<li>Open a new branch/MR for it</li>
<li>rebase the current branch to this new branch</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If you cannot fix it:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Discuss with your peer and see if it can be merged</li>
<li>If your peer agrees, let him post a comment under the merge
request and explain the reason for this failure</li>
<li>Maybe post a solution for this failure (Open a new task about
this)</li>
<li>Merge it</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org219eadb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org219eadb">Write reasons down</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org219eadb">
<p>
Don't let the reviewers guess the reasons behind your changes, so,
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>as an author</b>:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Make sure you write every commit message with enough contexts
</p>

<p>
But it also needs to be pointed out that contexts are really
important for a message. In another word, you should write down
<b>*why you are doing this change</b>:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Why is this refactor nesseccary? (e.g. The name is clearer)</li>

<li>Why remove this line of code? (e.g. For issue #1234, the code was
casuing xxx issue, removing it will still keep the behaviors the
same, but prevent xxx issue from happenning again)</li>
</ol>

<p>
You can also see a great example for commit message with enough
contexts here: <a href="https://youtu.be/PJjmw9TRB7s?t=7m51s">RailsConf 2015 - Implementing a Strong Code-Review
Culture - Commit Message Example</a>
</p></li>

<li><p>
Make sure you write every Merge Request message with enough contexts
</p>

<p>
It's the same idea as writting commit messages.
</p>

<p>
You should write down <b>*why and how this merge request can help solve
the issue</b>
</p>

<p>
A good template is like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
Before this merge request:
- (list the issues here)
- (or the reasons for the new feature)

This merge request:
- (list the changes here)
- (and try to guide your reviewer to follow your path)

After this merge request:
- (list the results here)
- (maybe attach the screenshot as well)

Thus fixes the issue
</pre></li>
</ol></li>
<li>And <b>as a reviewer</b>:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Post comments aggresively
</p>

<p>
If you think something is wrong, don't just reject the whole merge
request. Post a comment, and <b>discuss it with the author</b>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Record your discussions on GitLab
</p>

<p>
GitLab provides great tools for reviewing a merge request. (Like
commenting on a line of change, mentioning another MR/issue, etc.) Use
them well and keep every discussion on GitLab.
</p>

<p>
If your conversation happens on Slack, copy/paste it to GitLab comments.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Check the commit messages as well
</p>

<p>
Code Review is not only about reviewing code changes, we should also
check if the reason behind these changes are explained well.
</p>

<p>
If it's not, you may find yourself in a bad place trying to figure out
why the code looks like this when you try to <i>blame</i> this code after
several months.
</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org7fef38f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7fef38f">Keep your merge request small</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7fef38f">
<p>
It's hard to review code that's over hundreds of lines long. So, keep
your changes in a merge request small so that your reviewer will be
happier to review your code.
</p>

<p>
It's the best to keep your merge request small enough so that the
reviewer can review it in <b>under 10 minutes</b>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org510c858" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org510c858">Techniques to keep merge request small</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org510c858">
<p>
Since our merge requests are feature based now, sometimes it's hard to
keep the whole merge request small. Here are some techniques that
would help:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Keep your commit small
</p>

<p>
Although the merge request can be large, each commits in it can be small
enough (several lines of changes) and each with enough contexts.
</p>

<p>
So that you can guide your reviewer through the same path you went when
you developed this feature. And it would be easier to understand the
whole merge request step by step.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Use a feature branch
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Branch out a new feature branch</li>
<li>Branch out a small feature branch</li>
<li>Send merge request from small feature branch to feature branch.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So that the reviewer can review one change at a time.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Separate Refactor branch and Feature branch
</p>

<p>
It's kind of like 2 but worth explained separately.
</p>

<p>
It's highly recommended to REFACTOR your code first before you make
any changes so that the change can be made easier than before.
</p>

<p>
It will keep our codebase cleaner, and when a similar change comes,
it can be added easily as well.
</p>

<p>
Another advantage is that, even if the feature is rejected, the
refactor branch can still be merged, so your work is not completely
a waste of time.
</p></li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-org2dd5b75" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2dd5b75">Review your own merge request</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2dd5b75">
<p>
To make things easier for reviewers, I highly recommend review your
own merge request before sending it out to them.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1abe648" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1abe648">Fix silly mistakes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1abe648">
<p>
We all make silly mistakes sometimes, like typos or forgetting to
finish the descriptions.
</p>

<p>
It's the best chance for us to review our own merge requests again and
fix these embarrassing mistakes.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcb7d8c4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcb7d8c4">Review it as a reviewer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcb7d8c4">
<p>
After all, software development is all about empathy and how to make
other developers understand your code better.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing the merge request as the reviewer forces us to check our
merge requests in our reviewer's perspective. And we can see if the
code changes, commit messages, merge request descriptions, etc. etc.
all makes sense to a third person.
</p>

<p>
If not, we better fix the problem before we send it out to others.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org7608981" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7608981">Keep server branches clean</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7608981">
<p>
It's also important to keep the branches on our server as less as
possible. It doesn't make sense to keep a merged branch on our server.
And it will build a barrier for new developers to see what's really
going on.
</p>

<p>
<i>Do not destroy feature/bug/hotfix/refactor branches until they have
been merged into master branch</i>. But <b>do destroy them after they are
merged.</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>As the author</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Check the checkbox for <i>Remove source branch when merge request is
accepted.</i> when you open a new merge request.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>As the reviewer</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Check if <i>Remove source branch when merge request is accepted.</i> is
checked</li>
<li>If not, delete the branch after the merge request gets merged.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org427a71d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org427a71d">When to merge a merge request</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org427a71d">
<p>
The base line is: <b>merge a merge request when another dev approves it</b>
</p>

<p>
It doesn't matter who merges it, but the reviewer must give some
evidence that he/she has reviewed the changes (it can be a thumb-up
emoji, or a "reviewed" comment)
</p>

<p>
So that it's clear that the change has been reviewed and if anything
goes wrong, both reviewer and author need to take the responsibility
to fix it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2b43808" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2b43808">When to force merge</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2b43808">
<p>
If there is still something unresolved (failing specs, style issues,
etc.), and this merge request is kind of urgent, you can still merge
it. But make sure the unresolved issues get solved soon.
</p>

<p>
If there are just some style issues, and you trust the author enough,
you can just merge it and let him/her fix it in another merge request.
Everyone reviews their expertise Everyone should review their
expertise. So that everyone can learn the best from each other.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>As the author</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Send the merge request to different people to review</li>
<li>Guide them for the changes they need to review</li>

(e.g. you are a backend developer and the code is a mix of backend
and frontend code)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the merge request contains something out of your area of
expertise, don't hesitate to assign the rest of it to someone
