            <h1>GOOS: Build a Faster Feedback Loop</h1>
            <p>
I just finished reading Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by
Tests (a.k.a GOOS) a few months ago. And it's the best TDD book I've
read by far. It answered many of my questions about Testing and TDD.
</p>

<p>
In this post, I'll explain what I think that is the most valuable
thing from this book: the point of TDD is all about <b>building a faster
feedback loop</b>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgda9ed9e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgda9ed9e">Why do we need a fast feedback loop?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgda9ed9e">
<p>
I think in the reason for this was explained pretty well in <i>Chapter
1: What Is the Point of Test-Driven Development?</i>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Everything around our software is continuously changing</b></li>
<li>Our development process is a learning process for us to get more
familiar with the domain and the tools we have.</li>
<li><b>To make us learn faster, we need a faster feedback loop.</b></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Software Development as a Learning Process
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All but the most routine projects have elements of surprise
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Almost all software projects are attempting something that nobody has
done before</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Developers often don't completely understand the technologies they're
using
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>New apps can force even senior dev into unfamiliar corners</li>
<li>Complex system can be too complex to understand</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Customers and users have to look at their organization more closely
than they have before</li>
<li>Everyone involved has to learn as it progresses
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They all know there will be changes</li>
<li>They just don't know what changes</li>
<li>They need a process to <i>anticipate unanticipated changes</i></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0b70001" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0b70001">How does TDD help us to build a faster feedback loop?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0b70001">
<p>
TDD requires us to have the following three things, and they all make
the feedback loop in our development process faster.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd5fb485" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd5fb485">Different Levels of Testing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd5fb485">
<p>
<b>We need to have at least two levels of tests</b>:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Acceptance tests
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Acceptance tests set goals for our software's external
(user-facing) behaviors.</li>
<li>It has to be as end-to-end and automated as possible.</li>
<li>So we can know that a feature is completed when its acceptance
test passes.</li>
<li>And when it's passed, the code can be accepted into our code
base. (Thus it's called <b>Acceptance</b> test)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unit tests
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unit tests set goals for our software's internal (sub-system)
behaviors.</li>
<li>It has to be as simple as possible. (Just test the target unit)</li>
<li>So we can use these tests as guidance when we write little pieces
of code.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
These two levels of tests provides different levels of feedback for
our development process:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Feature level feedback (outer loops)</dt><dd><p>
Acceptance tests
</p>

<p>
Acceptance tests keep us on the right track for solving our
users' problems.
</p></dd>
<dt>Code level feedback (inner loops)</dt><dd><p>
Unit tests
</p>

<p>
Unit tests keep our internal code quality good, so that our
software can embrace changes easily when it needs to.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgcd7e362" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcd7e362">Constantly Automated Testing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcd7e362">
<p>
<b>We need to constantly run automated tests when we develop software</b>
</p>

<p>
Even if we have two different levels of tests, the feedback loop won't
help us if we don't run it constantly on our local machines or in our
CI pipelines.
</p>

<p>
GOOS tells us to run our tests constantly. It's definitely the best
practice because <b>nothing can beat automated tests on feedback
speeds.</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With automated tests, the feedback loop length is at <b>milliseconds</b>
level.</li>
<li>Without automated tests, say if we need to go to the browser and
refresh the page every time to test a UI change, the feedback loop
will be at least <b>seconds</b> long (even with the help of
auto-reloading, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
(P.S. This is also the reason we need to keep our tests fast.)
</p>

<p>
From my personal experience, I feel much more comfortable writing
backend code than frontend code now, because either it takes much more
time even if the tests are automated or it's just a lot harder to
automate. And switching to the browser and testing by hand really
makes me feel a lot more unproductive.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgfb02ac6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfb02ac6">Gather Feedback from Test Results</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfb02ac6">
<p>
<b>We need to constantly check the test results</b>.
</p>

<p>
Test results can give us incredible feedback on not only the
correctness but also many other parts of our code.
</p>

<p>
Let's take error messages as an example.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Error messages
</p>

<p>
One interesting points raised in GOOS is that we need to make
improving the diagnostics as part of the TDD cycle.
</p>

<p>
In another word, instead of following a typical red-green-refactor TDD
cycle, the TDD cycle GOOS recommends is that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Write a failing test (Red)</li>
<li>Make the diagnostics clear (Watch the test fail)</li>
<li>Make the test pass (Green)</li>
<li>Refactor (Refactor)</li>
</ol>

<p>
This cycle makes sure error messages are a important part of the
feedback our test. Because a good error message help us in three
ways:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It checks our assumptions about our code. If the message doesn't
make sense, there must be something wrong.</li>
<li>It checks our emphasis on expressing our intentions in this test,
which is fundamental for developing reliable, maintainable
systems.</li>
<li>Every time one test fails, we can fix it quickly and spend our
time on things that matters. (But this is just a nice
side-effect)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgafe5638" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgafe5638">Build fast feedback loops in our whole project life cycle.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgafe5638">
<p>
With these all said, I'm also thinking that we can apply this kind of
thinking in our project life cycle: <b>build a feedback loop for
everything we do, and always try to make it faster.</b>
</p>

<p>
In the project development process, we have tons of ways to gather
different feedback, I'll just take a list from GOOS that ranges from
seconds to months:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Pair programming
</p>

<p>
It's interesting to see it here, because it's an even faster loop
than unit tests. But it makes sense, and that's why it's great to
pair programming.
</p></li>

<li>Unit tests</li>
<li>Acceptance tests</li>
<li><p>
Code Review
</p>

<p>
Code Review is just like Pair programming, but it has a slower
feedback loop, which is why pair programming is better in this
sense.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Daily meetings
</p>

<p>
Scrum is a great example for this. By improving the team workflow,
we can get a faster feedback loop on project level.
</p></li>
<li>Iterations</li>
<li><p>
Releases
</p>

<p>
If we can release every day, then all the things above will be
forced to be faster as well. That's why we need to build daily (or
even faster).
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
P.S. Another interesting thing is that we can even take this thinking
into our daily life: <b>build a fast feedback loop for everything in our
life</b>, blog posts, fitness goals, you name it.
