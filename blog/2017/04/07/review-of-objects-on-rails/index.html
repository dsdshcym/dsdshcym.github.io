            <h1>Review of Objects on Rails</h1>
            <p>
This is my review of the book <a href="http://objectsonrails.com/">Objects on Rails</a>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This book shows us another way to build a web application based on Rails:
Write domain objects first, then use AR as an implementation detail. And use
patterns like dependency injection (DI) and Data-Context-Interaction (DCI)
to keep everything thin.</li>
<li>I think treating AR as an implementation detail is a great way to build
Rails application.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Even "Fat model, thin controller" can lead to really fat model classes.
We need to keep everything thin and follow SRP.</li>
<li>If we don't do this, then the model will violate SRP. Since it's both
responsible for data persistence and business logic. So let AR handle the
data persistence and let model object handle your business logic.</li>
<li>Another way to do this is to use composition. For every business model,
build a class for it and it don't inheritant from AR. If it needs to
persistent some data, build another AR class and composite it into the
business model object. It's more complicated than this solution but it
makes the responsibility separation more clear.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>And there's another article about what framework can influence the software
complexity: <a href="https://hackernoon.com/complexity-and-strategy-325cd7f59a92#.kgw67pysv">Complexity and Strategy</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rails can help us to build the software faster at the beginning of the
project.</li>
<li>But once the project becomes into a huge application, Rails will slow us
down.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>As it says in Complexity and Strategy: Framework can take us to a
higher point at the beginning, but it won't change the complexity curve
(the relation between functionality and cost). So the cost will become
higher as the app grows.</li>
<li><p>
As it says in this book:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The dark side of having sensible framework conventions is that after a
while, those conventions turn into assumptions
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Designing application in the way this book describes can let us understand
our domain problems better. And it won't use Rails until it's necessary.
So we'll start at a lower point in the complexity curve and can move
faster later.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For the Exhibit pattern, I agree with the idea to extract logic from view.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But I just feel the Exhibit pattern in this book is too much. It's like
another framework just for view layer.</li>
<li>If another new dev joins the team, he/she needs to learn this whole new
view framework to get into work.</li>
<li>And we can't get that many benifits from this framework.</li>
<li>In my current understanding, A facade between view and controller is
good enough. A controller builds a facade which contains all the
information the view needs. A view reference this facade object by
access method.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decoration vs Extension
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For the DCI part (extend Taggable on an instance object), I'm against it
at first. I think this is where we need to follow <i>Prefer composition over
inheritance</i> principle.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Decorator (or something similar using composition) can easily do the same
thing as the Taggable module did in this book.</li>
<li><p>
For the reasons to not use decorator in this book, I think it's not enough
to convince me to use DCI. But I can understand the reason behind this:
since AR is an implementation detail, and <code>#save</code> method is private, a
decorator cannot access <code>#save</code> method.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why use mixin instead of decorator?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we need the tight integration that only a module can give us.</li>
<li>For instance, intercepting <code>#save</code> within the object</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>But after I read <a href="../../Org/notes/software_engineering.html#ID-cde797bd-afc4-4769-a7e7-c44e4e8c9c75">Appendix C: Decoration vs. Dynamic Module Extension</a>, I
get the idea of extension here.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Decoration can fall apart when an undecorated method needs to call a
decorated method (it can't, it can only call the undecorated version)</li>
<li>How to choose between Decoration and Extension
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Decoration</dt><dd>For applications where you want to adorn an object with
some extra functionality, or modify how it presents
itself, a decorator is probably the best bet. Decorators
are great for creating Presenters, where we just want to
change an object’s “face” in a specific context.</dd>
<dt>Extension</dt><dd>On the other hand, when building up a composite object at
runtime object out of individual “aspects” or “facets”,
module extension may make more sense. Judicious use of
module extension can lead to a kind of “emergent
behavior” which is hard to replicate with decoration or
delegation.</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conclusion
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's more than one way to do it
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your project is not a Rails project; it is a software project, which uses
Rails to satisfy the need of projecting your business objects onto the
web.</li>
<li>Rails is not the framework; it is a part of your overall project
architecture.</li>
<li>So don't be afraid to build up your project's architecture.</li>
<li>There is very little new under the sun; whatever the problem you are
facing, chances are Kent Beck already solved it in Smalltalk.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
