            <h1>How to Build Software Without Estimates</h1>
            <p>
Do you know how much time you need to brush your teeth tomorrow? I do:
<i>4 minutes</i>. I can give this estimation with confidence because it's
based on my records from the past three years.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsdshcym/dsdshcym.github.io/f6aa7c3bcdc8c8033fc4aa9de8e42ee6a48e5763/assets/brush_teeth_logbook.png" alt="brush_teeth_logbook.png" width="75%" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
But estimating in software is hard.
</p>

<p>
I was once asked how long it would take to extract all the
configurations in a codebase to an yaml file. I said "I just need to
write a grep script to do that. So two days, at most!" Guess what
happened next? I spent <b>two months</b> on this refactoring task.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org398acb3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org398acb3">Why is estimating in software hard?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org398acb3">
<p>
So why is estimating software features harder than estimating brushing
teeth? The answer is simple: because predicting the future is hard.
</p>

<p>
But we can learn from our past, just record all the time spent on
every feature! Yes, our past experience can help a lot, but only when
we are estimating how long it would take to finish a repetitive task,
like brushing teeth.
</p>

<p>
Building software is more complicated than brushing teeth. In
particular, every software is new and <a href="https://www.jrothman.com/mpd/project-management/2013/10/why-do-we-estimate-anyway/">we have not built <i>exactly</i> this
software before</a> (if not, we would extract it as a library or
framework). So every estimate we make involves some future
predictions. And these future predictions can be inaccurate.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org33230df" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org33230df">Shipping values is the key</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org33230df">
<p>
So how to build software without estimates? Remember, estimate is
about predicting the future, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/328848-the-best-way-to-predict-your-future-is-to-create">"the best way to predict the future
is to create it"</a>. <b>Focus on shipping values</b>, which is the only way we
create the future for our software.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2a92635" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2a92635">Manage risks (a.k.a. Shape Up your ideas)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2a92635">
<p>
To ship values, we need a tool for managing potential risks. Without
estimates as a gateway to talk about risks, how do we manage risks?
</p>

<p>
Let's set a deadline first, and bet on tasks that seem to be feasible
within this time range. Then keep reducing risks that may prevent us
shipping before the deadline. This is what <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> means to
Basecamp. (And I also wrote a post about the same idea before:
<a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/estimating-is-hard-lets-cut-scope/">Estimating is Hard, Let's Cut Scope!</a>)
</p>

<p>
Basically, it reverts the estimation process.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When estimating, we have a fix design/spec, then we estimate how
long it would take.</li>
<li>When shaping up, we fix the deadline, then we find a solution that
can fit into the time range.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why it works better than time estimations? For every problem, we have
infinite possible solutions. While time is equal to everyone, no one
can earn back another second. So the scope of the solution is more
flexible than time. We can and should cut the scope if we know we are
not gonna make it. With scopes reduced, our risks are reduced too. On
the other hand, estimating has this natural assumption that the scope
is fixed, and should not be modified (though it's often
expanded). Then we can't manage risks after an estimate is given.
</p>

<h3 id="org9f637d0">Help stakeholders get rid of estimates</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9f637d0">
<p>
But if you are working with someone who is used to asking for
estimations and you can't transfer to the Shape Up method, you need to
help her to shift her mindset. You have two powerful tools to do that.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Build trust with your communication skills.</li>
<li>Ship values steadily with your coding skills.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a href="http://blog.hut8labs.com/no-deadlines-for-you.html">This article from Dan Milstein</a> uses a real-world example to show what
good communication skills look like.
</p>

<p>
The key idea is that we can build trust with the business people by
understanding the real business value/problem behind a proposed
solution. Sounds familiar? It's the same idea of Shape Up or Cut
Scopes. It's also a key idea from <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2019/06/24/life-changing-tools-book-review-non-violent-communication/">Nonviolent Communication</a>: <b>asking
for what they really want and be creative about the solution</b>.
</p>

<p>
In order to know their real needs, we need to communicate it in a
skillful way. The most important skill is echoing back what others
just said. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=ampp+crucial+conversations">The Ask, Mirror, Paraphrase, or Prime (AMPP) method</a> from
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822">Crucial Conversations</a> taught me how to do it well.
</p>

<p>
After this trust is built, we can focus on shipping values
steadily. As long as we ship new features/bug fixes every day, every
week, the stakeholder won't ask us for estimates anymore. How to do
that? Well, you need engineering practices like automated testing,
continuous integration, and so on. But that's a topic for another day.

Since our estimations are so inaccurate, some says "we don't
trust the estimate result, it doesn't matter if you need 1 hour or 1
week. We use estimate point like Small, Large, Extra Large. And the
goal is to make sure everyone understands the risk equally. If one
estimates XL but I estimate S, then we need to talk." I don't believe
in this idea. If we need to know the potential risks, just ask for
them! Plus, different people hold different understandings of S, L,
XL, so good luck making sure everyone uses them equally beforehand.
