Think about these typical situations in our work and life everyday:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You just shipped an awesome feature. Then your client asks you to
add some commas or periods here and there. You feel angry and
think: why is he focusing on these details and ignoring all the
awesome work I've done?</li>
<li>You just submitted a merge request. Then your reviewer says you are
doing it all wrong. (Or you are the reviewer and you want to say
this code sucks.)</li>
<li>You are in your annual performance review meeting. And they say you
didn't perform well last year. They say you don't communicate
often, you write bad code, you don't ship features fast enough,
yada yada yada. You completely disagree to all of these. And you
don't know what to do next.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org706bc19">
<div class="notes">
<p>
Feedback includes any information you get from this world about yourself.
So even your reflection in the mirror counts as feedback.
</p>

<p>
In communication, feedback comes in three forms...
</p>

<p>
That being said, we often mix different forms of feedback
together.
</p>

<p>
As we will see later, it's extremely easy for us to mix evaluation
with other feedback:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"you did well in this project, thank you" is both evaluation and
appreciation,</li>
<li>"your code sucks, write it in this way" is both evaluation and
coaching.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To simplify things a bit, in this talk, we will focus on coaching and
evaluation.
</p>

</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Any information you get about yourself.</b></li>
<li>Broadly, feedback comes in three forms:

<h3 id="orgc1eb9bd">Feedback almost equals to communication</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc1eb9bd">
<div class="notes">
<p>
Feedback is the most important part of our communication.
</p>

<p>
If you think about it, our communication is based on information, it's
a flow of information.
</p>

<p>
And information can be categorized into two types:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>information about ourselves. that's feedback.</li>
<li>information that's not about ourselves. i call it data. it can be
opinions of others or facts about this world.</li>
</ol>

<p>
That being said, data can still become feedback. After all, we live in
our own life, which is about and only about ourselves. So the data may
not relate to us directly, we can still transform it to some kinds
of feedback about ourselves.
</p>

<p>
For example, this presentation about feedback is only data (at least
it's what I hope it to be), but you can relate it to yourself, to how
you give and receive feedback before. Then this presentation becomes
feedback.
</p>

<p>
This is important because feedback is how we learn ourselves.
</p>

<h3 id="orgd2234ef">Feedback is how we learn and teach</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd2234ef">
<div class="NOTES">
<p>
In the broadest sense, feedback is how we learn about ourselves from
our experiences and from other people—how we learn from life.
</p>

<p>
And we all know how learning is important to us as humans.
</p>

<p>
But, learning about ourselves can be painful and teaching others can
be hard.
</p>

<p>
For example, <b>you can't take a developer team and tell them: do code
reviews, write tests, and learn TDD!</b> And expect them to just start
doing these things. Right?
</p>

<p>
In addition to our desire to learn and improve, we long for something
else that is fundamental: to be loved, accepted, and respected just as
we are.
</p>

<p>
And the very fact of feedback suggests that how we are is not quite
okay.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why can’t you accept me for who I am and how I am?</li>
<li>Why are there always more adjustments, more upgrades?</li>
<li>Why is it so hard for you to understand me?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Despite the fact that it's hard to give and receive feedback, they are
what we do everyday.
</p>

</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After all, humans are naturally wired for learning.</li>
<li>We may be wired to learn, but it turns out that learning
<i>about ourselves</i> is a whole different game.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge450669">
<div class="notes">
<p>
Here are three feedback practices that I think every one of us can
improve.
</p>

<p>
First, we need to find out what we really want when giving or
receiving feedback. And focus on that.
</p>

<p>
Then, we need to make it safe for the feedback giver or receiver to
talk. Make sure you have a mutual purpose and you respect each other.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we will see the feedback cycle and break it down into
steps. We can improve every step in this cycle to help us give and
receive feedback better.

<p>
As feedback givers, we need to clarify what you really want.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To help the project?</li>
<li>To help this person?</li>
<li>To make your life easier?</li>
</ul>

<p>
And what you really don't want.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not to make the other angry</li>
<li>Not to win the debate</li>
</ul>

<p>
As feedback receivers, we can ask what the giver wants and doesn't want.
</p>

<p>
Then we can combine them together and ask ourselves how to achieve
these two goals at the same time. There ought to be a solution.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is there a way to tell your peer your real concerns and not insult
or offend him?</li>
<li>Is there a way to talk with your loved one about how you’re
spending money and not get into an argument?</li>
</ul>

</div>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First, clarify what you really want.</li>
<li>Second, clarify what you really don’t want.</li>

<h3 id="org484e95d">Make it Safe</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org484e95d">
<div class="notes">
<p>
After knowing what we really want and focus on only that, we can start
by making the conversation safe first.
</p>

<p>
More than too often, it's how or when we give the feedback that
triggers the other, not the feedback itself.
</p>

<p>
So, step out of the content, and build a mutual purpose. Make it
explicit what you really want. And see if the other resonates.
</p>

<p>
Besides this mutual purpose, you need to respect each other. Saying
"your code sucks" directly may hurt a developer's feelings. So you
need to build a mutual purpose (I want to help you improve your code)
and a mutual respect (I respect you as a developer, your code cannot
represent you as a person, we only discuss code here) first, then
explain tons of reasons, at last you may be able to say "this code
sucks" together.
</p>

</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Step out of the content of the conversation.</b></li>
<li>Don’t stay stuck in what’s being said.</li>
<li>Notice what's at risk

<li>Data is our input information. What the other is doing, saying,

interpret it, and tell a story from the data, label different
characters. Someone is looking at his laptop. He's not interested
at my talk I prepared for a whole week. He doesn't want to improve
his communication skills.</li>
<li>Then based on this story, our brain generates thoughts and
feelings. -&gt; "What a non-respectful &amp; ungrateful bastard."</li>
<li>Then we have our intentions or requests to others. "Be more
respectful to me. Don't look at your cell phone and listen to me."</li>
<li>Finally, our behaviour becomes other's input data.</li>
<li>And the cycle repeats on the other side.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Equipped with the awareness of this cycle, we can work on each steps
here and improve our feedback cycle.

<p>
After we separate data from interpretation, the next thing we can do
is to own our interpretation, master our story.
</p>

<p>
From the same data, we as humans can generate completely different
stories.

<p>
"Doug only studies for exams the night before. And he passes all the exams."

<li>He procrastinates, he doesn't study hard. He must be cheating in
all these exams.</li>

Mastering our story is important because it helps us to stay on what
we really want. We cannot start with our hearts or make the
conversation safe if we think the other is the only problem here.

Our story is never complete and we can understand another better and
give feedback more efficiently if we try to tell the rest of story
first.

<p>
Most of the time, the communication problem exists because we are
different.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

We see things differently. So we have different data.

</p></li>

<li>We have different brains, body structures, cells. We have different
background. So we interpret that (different) data differently.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then, we can try to learn the other person's story. How he/she sees
things differently from me. By figuring out the differences between
our data and our interpretations, we can focus on the right part of
the feedback and learn from that.

<p>
After found out the right part of the feedback, we can start giving
our requests based on our intentions.
</p>

<p>
First, we need to make it clear if we are giving or receiving coaching
or evaluation. It's hard to focus on coaching if they are mixed
together. Because evaluation can draw our attention or even disturb
our emotions.
</p>

<p>
Then, when coaching or receiving coaching, we need to clarify the
real, actionable advice here. Without a clear, actionable item or
task, we can hardly work on the coaching advice. No matter if you are
a giver or a receiver, you can always ask yourself, if a person do
want to follow the advice, would he/she know how to do so?
</p>

<p>
It's also useful to only name one thing at one time. Do one thing and
do it well. Find the top priority here.
</p>

<p>
Finally, when giving or receiving evaluations, clarify consequences
and expectations. Especially when the evaluation is done and we can do
nothing to change the result. So knowing the consequences is actually
more important than what to do next.

That being said, we can still sort toward coaching all the time, even
when you are given an final evaluation. My RubyConf China talk
proposal got rejected last week. This is an final evaluation for
sure. I couldn't do anything to change that. But that doesn't mean the
end to me. I can still ask for what I can do better next time.
</p>

<p>
That means we need to cultivate a growth identity. We need to change
our world view first.
