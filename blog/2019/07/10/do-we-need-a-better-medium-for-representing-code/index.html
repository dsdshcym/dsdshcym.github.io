<p>
After all these years of writing code as texts, I completely agree
that text is not a good medium for storing code. But I'm afraid that
texts won't go away in any near future. In this clipping, I would
explain why text is a bad format, show several attempts to fix this
problem, and finally, why text is gonna stay for long.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf149a4e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf149a4e">Why are texts bad?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf149a4e">
<p>
After all, the sole purpose of writing code is to express our
ideas. There are many ways to express ideas. Other than texts, we can
express ideas with drawing, illustrating, speaking, performing, and so
on.
</p>

<p>
The text format became so popular and dominated almost all programming
language because it's the easiest and cheapest way for machines to
understand our ideas. We didn't have any sophisticated technologies
for machines to recognize our voices, pictures, facial or body
languages decades before. (And we still don't have any of these
technologies now.)
</p>

<p>
Even though text is so popular, I still feel the pain from the fact
that we will lose so much information when translating ideas into code
in plain text. Most of the time, the code we write is only the
executable part of the idea: how a feature should work. Other more
important information, like why this feature works in this way, was
lost in the translating process.
</p>

<p>
When running the code, this information loss won't create any
trouble. As long as the code express the logic correctly in a way that
machines can understand, machines will do exactly what they are told
to do. The problem occurs when we try to understand the idea behind
the code and we need to update this idea.
</p>

<p>
Here are some typical cases I ran into everyday:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Go to definitions
</p>

<p>
Maybe it's because I don't use the most powerful IDE or the most
advanced plugins, I still rely on text pattern matcher like <code>grep</code>
and <code>rg</code> to find the location of module definitions and variable
definitions. And every once a while, my attempt to jump to a
definition would fail because there are modules with similar names
or something like that.
</p>

<p>
Every occurrences of a class name, variable name is actually saying
"we are going to use the idea represented by this name here." And
since the runtime can understand this fact easily, our tooling
should be able to do this as well.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Change variable/class names
</p>

<p>
On the other way around, I should be able to change a class name
while not changing any existing behaviours of my application. But
currently in most dynamic languages like Ruby, I still need to rely
on text search and replace every occurrence manually.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Documentation &amp; test
</p>

<p>
To me, documentation and test are also important aspects of our
ideas. They explain why the code works like this and gives examples
of how to use this code.
</p>

<p>
But in most languages, documentations are not tightly attached to
the code itself, so many documentations are telling lies. Tests are
often placed in a separated file and in a separated directory. It's
a hassle to switch between test file and implementation file, not
to mention to understand them as a whole.
</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgfe1f7e4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfe1f7e4">What does this "better" look like?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfe1f7e4">
<p>
The ideal situation is for our machines and tools to understand our
ideas better and then support our work as programmers in a better
way. Like what's said in the tweets above, we should be able to switch
between different whatever views or aspects of an idea. Then, it's
natural for us to jump to definitions as we wish, and change names
without breaking the application in any way.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgab73e88" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgab73e88">Attempts to fix this problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgab73e88">
<p>
This is not a new idea. And there are tons of solutions out there
trying to help machines to understand our thoughts better already.
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Type systems</dt><dd><p>
By specifying type information explicitly, we help
the machine to understand more aspects of our
program.
</p>

<p>
But writing type information can become
cumbersome. (Just think about languages like Java)
</p>

<p>
Type annotations and inference can help a lot. See
TypeScript, <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html">dialyzer for erlang and elixir</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet">sorbet for Ruby</a>.
</p></dd>
<dt>IDEs &amp; LSP</dt><dd>IDEs like IntelliJ by JetBrains and the Language
Server Protocol by Microsoft are tools that leverages
parsers and compilers to help us modify our code more
efficiently.</dd>
<dt>Visual Programming Language</dt><dd>Pure visual languages like <a href="https://medium.com/@noelrap/prograph-c3caa90b89e8">Prograph</a> are attempts to program in
more formats other than text. It's a pity that they are not
popular enough.</dd>
<dt>Integrated Language Design</dt><dd>Languages like Smalltalk was developed with developing experience
in mind. And they provide a complete tool chain to support this
experience.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
I'm excited to see new languages like Dark which promises to
follow this direction as well:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The defining principle behind Dark is that we want to remove all
accidental complexity from coding.</li>
<li>The core problem here is that the tools we have been
building — as an industry — are incremental.</li>
<li>Decreasing complexity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Infrastructure complexity</li>
<li>Deployment complexity</li>
<li>API complexity</li>
<li>Code-as-text complexity</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

</p></li>
<li><p>
And also there are some similar attempts to add this kind of
integration to existing languages like JavaScript:
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is awesome! We&#39;re just finishing up the editor for <a href="https://twitter.com/darklang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@darklang</a>, and it works almost exactly like this!</p>&mdash; Paul Biggar (@paulbiggar) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulbiggar/status/1136034871560687617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2019</a></blockquote>

</ul></dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8775459" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8775459">Do we need a better medium?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8775459">
<p>
That being said, would text go away from programming world eventually?
And would some multimedia format replace text completely? I really
doubt that.
</p>

<p>
After all, we've been using text as a communicating medium for too
long. Since the first human started drawing characters on oracle
bones, text has become the best choice for our async communications.
And as I mentioned above, writing code is communicating our ideas. So
text is still and will remain to be our best choice.
</p>

<p>
But there are still many things we can do out there. The goal is for
machines to understand our ideas better without too much extra help
from programmers.
</p>

<p>
And eventually, we will build new abstractions upon our existing text
format. New languages like Dark will appear and become more and more
popular. Just like what high level languages did to assembly and
machine code.
</p>

<p>
I can't wait to see more possibilities like this.
