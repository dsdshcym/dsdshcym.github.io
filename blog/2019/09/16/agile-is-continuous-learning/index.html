            <h1>Agile Is Continuous Learning</h1>
            <p>
In the software industry, there is no word buzzier than "Agile". Most
companies are "Agile" building their software. But not every company
is building software in the same way. Company A's "Agile" is different
from (if not opposite to) company B's. It seems to be unlimited
definitions for "Agile" out there. So what really is "Agile"? And why
is "Agile" so popular in the software industry?
</p>

<p>
To me, being agile means <b>to learn continuously</b>. We work in smaller
chunks to learn in a finer granularity. We iterate or make changes to
learn in a broader space. We gather feedback more often to learn
faster.
</p>

<p>
To understand how I came to this conclusion, we need to go back to
check the goal of "Agile", think about ways to achieve this goal, then
the reason for why "Agile" = Continuous Learning is obvious.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orga4ba334" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga4ba334">The Goal of "Agile" Is to Deliver Valuable Software</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga4ba334">
<p>
<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> is one of the most famous
document defining what "Agile" is. Most people (including me before
writing this post) only knows the four values from the Manifesto.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
Working Software over comprehensive documentation
Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to Change over following a plan
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the Manifesto contains not only these values, but also several
principles. The goal of "Agile" is at the top of these <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">principles
behind the Agile Manifesto</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
continuous delivery of valuable software.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, all the "Agile" values, movements, practices, frameworks are
aiming for the same goal: <b>delivering valuable software.</b>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org61d7935" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org61d7935">Delivering Valuable Software Requires Continuous Learning</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org61d7935">
<p>
But delivering valuable software is hard, really hard. It's hard
because every aspect of it is a moving target.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
The definition of "Value" is not consistent
</p>

<p>
The definition of value is changing all the time. Customers often
don't know what they really need. And they are always asking for more
(different) values. So the problem our software need to solve is
a moving target.
</p></li>

<li><p>
The solution space is so large
</p>

<p>
Even if a given problem is well-defined, there won't be a best
solution. There would always be a faster algorithm, a more secure
implementation, or a more elegant architecture. I really love how Li
Hongyi phrased this problem in <a href="https://www.csc.gov.sg/articles/how-to-build-good-software">How to Build Good Software</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In software development, most ideas are bad; this is not anyoneâ€™s
fault. It is just that <b>the number of possible ideas is so large</b> that
any particular idea is probably not going to work, even if it was
chosen very carefully and intelligently.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
The building blocks are changing
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, modern software is building upon layers of
building blocks: frameworks, libraries, languages, operating
systems, hardware, and third-party apis. Each of these building
blocks are out of our control. Once they change, our working
software may fail immediately.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Then the question of <i>how to deliver valuable software</i> becomes <i>how
to hit all these moving targets at the same time.</i>
</p>

<p>
The answer is quite simple (but not easy): <b>learn as fast as we can</b>, to
catch up the rate of these changes.
</p>

<p>
No one can predict the future. If we can, then we will just build the
thing which can satisfy all the future needs and prevent all the
future bugs. So the best thing we can do is to learn from the past and
the present.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Learn what's valuable to customers now and pivot accordingly.</li>
<li>Learn different solutions and always iterate to a better one.</li>
<li>Learn the building blocks and catch up with their changes.</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-orge73a9fa" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge73a9fa">Thus, "Agile" Is All About Continuous Learning</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge73a9fa">
<p>
As you can see above, continuous learning is the way to deliver
valuable software. And "Agile" is aimed for valuable software. So
naturally "Agile" is all about continuous learning.
</p>

<p>
And that's also why "Agile" becomes so popular among the software
industry. If "Agile" wasn't called "Agile", but "Nimble" or
"Lightsome", as long as it expressed the same idea of continuous
learning, it would still conquer the world.
</p>

<p>
So how does "Agile" enables continuous learning?
</p>

<p>
<b>Feedback</b> is the key to continuous learning. After all, <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2019/07/07/how-to-give-receive-feedback/">feedback is
how we learn about our software and ourselves</a>. Without feedback, we
can't learn how well we understand the value to our customer. Without
feedback, we can't learn how well our software fits the
problem. Without feedback, we can't know what we need to change due to
an upstream updates.
</p>

<p>
As you can see from the graph below, feedback cycles are everywhere in
software development.
</p>
<pre class="example">
Planning &lt;-------------\
   |                   |
   |                   |
   v                   |
Designing &lt;-----------&gt;|
   |                   |
   |                   |
   v                   |
Developing &lt;----------&gt;| Feedback
   |                   |
   |                   |
   v                   |
Shipping &lt;------------&gt;|
   |                   |
   |                   |
   v                   |
 User  &lt;--------------&gt;/
</pre>
<p>
There are three levels of feedback cycles in this graph:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A big cycle which includes every step (from Plan to User feedback)</li>
<li>Small cycles between two steps (e.g. Plan &lt;-&gt; Design, Design &lt;-&gt;
Develop, etc.)</li>
<li>Internal cycles within each step (e.g. Code Reviews, Automated
Testing when Developing the software)</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>The shorter these feedback cycles are, the faster we can learn, the
faster we can improve our products.</b>
</p>

<p>
So all the "Agile" frameworks is aimed to <b>shorten our feedback loops</b>
in one way or another. Here are some common ideas:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Work on fewer, smaller features or products, which is basically the
idea of MVP. So that we can have a shorter big cycle.</li>
<li>Involve every team member (including client or user) in every
step. So that we can have shorter small cycles between steps.</li>
<li>Collaborate closely, e.g. pair programming, code reviews, design
criticize, etc. So that we can get shorter internal cycles within
each steps.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This is how I understand Agile now. Hopefully, it can reduce some of
your confusions about Agile. If you have different opinions, please do
let me know, I'd be glad to learn more!
