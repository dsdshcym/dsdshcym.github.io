If you ask me: who's been the best mentor I've ever had? I'll pick
several names: <a href="http://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2017/12/08/book-review-99-bottles-of-oop/#orgb711f32">Sandi Metz</a>, <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/04/07/tdd-gives-you-a-tractable-task-board/">J. B. Rainsberger</a>, <a href="http://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2017/04/09/review-of-refactoring-improving-the-design-of-existing-code/">Martin Fowler</a>, <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/03/14/clippings-from-the-secrets-of-consulting/">Gerald
Weinberg</a>, and so on. They are all great software consultants. I've
learned a lot from their books, talks, and online courses. Naturally,
I'm curious about their work: consulting.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What is consulting?</li>
<li>What is a consultant?</li>
<li>How can I become a successful consultant?</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the book <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Million-Dollar-Consulting-Professionals-Practice/dp/1259588610/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">Million Dollar Consulting</a></i>, I found answers to all these
questions and more. Most importantly, the wisdom from this book can be
applied not only to consulting itself, but also to almost all kinds of
work.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org546a8a5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org546a8a5">"We are all consultants"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org546a8a5">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant">Wikipedia</a> defines consultant as "a professional who provides expert
advice in a particular area". But this book gives a different
definition: a consultant is <i>an <b>expert</b> in one or more identified
areas who partners with a client to improve the client’s condition.</i>
</p>

<p>
The key is to improve the client's condition, not to give advice. In
this sense, almost every company, every people is a consultant. A
product company like Google builds products to improve its users'
condition. An employee is an expert who's hired to improve the
employer's (or its clients') condition.
</p>

<p>
Advice is just one of the best tools to improve the client's
condition. As the book says: <i>great consultants teach others how to do
what they do and do not create codependencies.</i> Thus,
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a consultant gives advice to teach its client;</li>
<li>a product strives for user-friendliness to teach users how to use
itself;</li>
<li>an employee becomes a mentor to teach juniors how to do senior
stuffs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org187e962" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org187e962">"Wealth is discretionary time"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org187e962">
<p>
Knowing that improving the client's condition is the key of our work,
we also need to realize that <i>money is simply the means to obtain
wealth.</i> We have to <b>continually work smarter, not harder.</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For a consultant, <i>the key is to minimize labor while maximizing
fees.</i></li>
<li>For a product team, the key is to minimize development efforts while
maximizing feature sets (thus maximize the price).</li>
<li>For an employee, the key is to minimize work while maximizing
impacts (thus maximize the compensation).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgc6551f7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc6551f7">"Marketing is the art and science of creating need"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc6551f7">
<p>
To work smarter, marketing is one of the best tool we have. After all,
without marketing, people won't know our great product even if we can
build it effectively. That's why Rob Walling advocates "<a href="https://robwalling.com/2010/10/14/startup-marketing-part-6-why-you-should-start-marketing-the-day-you-start-coding/">start
marketing the day you start coding</a>".
</p>

<p>
Then the book gives a way to market yourself as a consultant:
<b>creating market gravity</b>, from passive methods like blog posts,
books, public speaking, to active methods like advertising,
referrals. Again, this market gravity thinking is universal:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For a consultant, she needs to generate and sustain market gravity
to attract more clients.</li>
<li>For a product team, they need to generate and sustain market gravity
to attract more users.</li>
<li>For an employee, she needs to generate and sustain market gravity to
increase her impact.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0b74188" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0b74188">"Every business is a relationships business"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0b74188">
<p>
After the market gravity is sustained, the real business starts to
kick in. But what is the key to business after all? The original quote
from the book says "every business is a communications business". But
as the book states right after:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Language controls discussions</li>
<li>Discussions control relationships</li>
<li>Relationships control business</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
What does "relationships control business" mean anyway? I believe
<a href="https://yiming.dev/blog/2019/10/09/how-to-build-software-without-estimates/">trust is the key in a great relationship</a>. If your customer doesn't
trust your incentive, she won't sign the contract; if your customer
doesn't trust your ability, she won't buy any product from you. On the
other hand, if your customer trust your incentive, you can get to a
conceptual agreement easily; if your customer trust your ability, even
your product is not great yet, she can still buy it and count on you
to improve it.
</p>

<p>
So every business is a <b>relationships</b> business.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For a consultant, the key is to establish great relationships with
clients and prospects.</li>
<li>For a product team, the key is to establish great relationships with
users (also within the team).</li>
<li>For an employee, the key is to establish great relationships with
employers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org414b9dc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org414b9dc">Don't charge by the hour, "charge by value"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org414b9dc">
<p>
Then the question comes down to how to charge your work. The answer
from this book is: charge by the value, never charge by the hour.
</p>

<p>
This thinking resonates with my personal experiences. I've worked on
several hourly-billing projects, and it doesn't work well for me.
(I'll write another post to elaborate why hourly-billing doesn't work,
stay tuned!)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org51b5f60" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org51b5f60">Work for yourself</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org51b5f60">
<p>
The final advice that strikes me from this book is preferring to be a
solo practitioner and work for yourself.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>The only thing worse than shedding sweat and blood for your business
is shedding sweat and blood for someone else’s business.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This idea is exactly what <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Company-One-Staying-Small-Business-ebook/dp/B078962RHQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525875626&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=company+of+one&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=eik05-20&amp;linkId=470605f6117f60ed70b3b4268f0e78d1">"Company of one"</a> means. As always, great
ideas are never new. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Million-Dollar-Consulting-Alan-Weiss/dp/0071622101">The first edition of Million Dollar Consulting</a>
came out in 2009. And the book <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Company-One-Staying-Small-Business-ebook/dp/B078962RHQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525875626&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=company+of+one&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=eik05-20&amp;linkId=470605f6117f60ed70b3b4268f0e78d1">Company of one</a></i> came out in 2019. 10
years have passed, more and more people are joining the army of one.
</p>

<p>
I believe with the help of modern technologies, we will see more and
more companies of one. Maybe in 2029, I'll be working for my own
company of one too.
