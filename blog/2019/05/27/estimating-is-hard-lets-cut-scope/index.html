            <h1>Estimating is Hard, Let&#39;s Cut Scope!</h1>
            <p>
When building products nowadays, <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/05/15/why-do-we-need-a-plan/">we need a plan</a>. We need to answer
five questions in this plan:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Why?</dt><dd>Why are we building this product?</dd>
<dt>Who?</dt><dd>Who's gonna be involved and build this product?</dd>
<dt>How?</dt><dd>How to build this product?</dd>
<dt>When?</dt><dd>When will we deliver this product?</dd>
<dt>What?</dt><dd>What features does this product have?</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Typically, the first three questions have been answered before we
start planning for the project.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you don't know <b>why</b> you are working on this project now, you'd
better find that out first.</li>
<li>If you don't know <b>who</b> is going to join the project for sure, at
least you are involved for sure now.</li>
<li>If you don't know <b>how</b> to build this project, it would be a lot
harder to plan. But I assume you already have your own way of work,
your own familiar tech stacks, and your own collaborating style
between team members already.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But finding answers for the rest two questions is the most difficult
job when planning.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to give estimation for a feature?</li>
<li>How to define the scope for your project?</li>
</ul>
<p>
We all struggled on these questions before. And we've come up with
different Agile frameworks. They all encourage us to set deadlines for
tasks. (Sprint for Scrum, Due date for Kanban, etc.) Why is that the
case for all kinds of different frameworks?
</p>

<p>
In this post, I want to give a hypothetical formula to explain the
relationship between these elements. Based on this formula, I'll
explain why I believe <i>setting deadlines + cutting scope</i> is the way
to solve this puzzle.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org86e5280" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org86e5280">The Project Management Formula</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org86e5280">
<p>
When I tried to explain why software development is hard to others, I
came up with this formula (inspired by <a href="https://www.feltpresence.com/functions.html">Ryan Singer: Products Are
Functions</a>) to demonstrate the relationship between several constraints
in our daily work:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
F(when, how, who) = what
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Or put it in another way: <i>what</i> features you finally get is a
function of how much time you put into it (<i>when</i>), <i>how</i> you organize
the work, and <i>who</i> are going to do it.
</p>

<p>
The relationships between them are of course more complex than a
simple linear function like <code>when * how * who = what</code>. So let me
explain a bit more:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b>What</b> (What features you can get.)
</p>

<p>
We want our products to be good. And products are mainly defined by
its features. So our main focus would be the features we build for
our product.
</p>

<p>
And it contains two aspects:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Quantity: How many features this product has.</li>
<li>Quality: How good each feature is.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Details</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Interactions</li>
<li>Security</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
These two aspects would be reflected in the specification or the
scopes we are going to define. Basically, we are going to define
what we are going to build and how well they are in the plan phase.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>When</b> (How much time you put into it.)
</p>

<p>
Typically, given the same people and workflow, the more time we put
into a project, the more features, the better feature we can get.
</p>

<p>
We need to <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/02/27/only-with-limited-resources-can-we-finish-things/">give a deadline</a> for the scope we defined. Without an
agreed schedule, a plan would not be called a plan.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
So given the assumption that we are certain about <i>how</i> to work and
<i>who</i> to join, the formula become much simpler: <code>F(when) = what</code>.
</p>

<p>
So how can we solve this formula to finish our plan? Or how are we
going to decide <i>when</i> and <i>what</i>? Shall we define the scope first,
then do the estimation? Or set a deadline first, then give the scope
based on this deadline?
</p>

<p>
My answer is to <b>set a deadline first.</b>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge1808f6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge1808f6">Why Define the Deadline First?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge1808f6">
<p>
I proclaim here that by deciding <i>when</i> (the deadline) before <i>what</i>
(the scope), we would come up with a better plan and execute it in a
more efficient way. Here are several reasons behind this bold claim:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
We are more used to planning based on deadlines than giving
estimations based on scopes.
</p>

<p>
Everyone is familiar with time and date. We've been living with
them everyday since we were born. We know the time we are going to
have dinner. We know the date we are going to school. And we plan
for them with the time info in our mind. So every one of us has the
skill to make a plan based on a deadline.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, product scope is quite a stranger to most of us
and we don't estimate often in our daily life. It's not common to
ask how much time you still need to finish that meal. Therefore, if
we are only required to give time estimations in our projects, we
are lacking a lot of practices.
</p></li>

<li>Embrace scope change, not deadline change.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Deadlines are easier to agree upon than scopes.
</p>

<p>
Time and date are not only familiar to most people but also well
defined and agreed upon. Next Monday of "<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2019-05-29 Wed]</span></span>" is
"<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2019-06-03 Mon]</span></span>" to everyone. A timestamp always means the
same.
</p>

<p>
But it's not the case for features, or scopes.
</p>

<p>
What do you mean by "Users can search blog posts by keywords"?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What's the definition for "search"? Is it Fuzzy search or exact
match?</li>
<li>What's the performance requirement? Respond in 1 second or 100
millisecond?</li>
<li>What's the UI/UX requirement? How fancy the search box we need it
to be? (Or do we even need a search box?)</li>
</ul>

<p>
As we can see in this example, features or scopes are extremely
hard to define.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Even if we have pages of detailed specifications, one can still
easily come up with a new aspect that's not mentioned at all.</li>
<li>Even if we write down all these specifications, different people
can still have different understanding of the same
statement.</li>
</ol>
<p>
That's part of why giving time estimation is hard: how can you give
an accurate estimation for an inaccurate (and never will be
accurate) specification?
</p></li>

<li><p>
Scopes are more prone to change than deadlines.
</p>

<p>
Due to the fact that we can never have a well-defined scope, we
tend to and have to change the scope on the go. It's (almost if
not absolutely) impossible to keep the scope unchanged after the
real work is started.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
We have to change the scope even after it's defined.
</p>

<p>
We will always learn more about the domain we are working on,
the technology we are using, the assumptions we are
making. And as we learn more, it's just a matter of time to
find our "well-defined" scope needs to be refined in one way
or another.
</p></li>

<li><p>
We tend to change the scope even after it's defined.
</p>

<p>
Since everyone has a different understanding on specs, it's
easy for us to just add another detail to this feature to
make it more polished, more performant, or more
user-friendly. But the scope is expanded. And after several
small additions like this, we will have a scope that's much
larger than what we have in the beginning.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
So what happens after this kind of scope change? We have to work
more to produce this bigger <i>what</i> (remember the formula
<code>F(when) = what</code>?). There are only two possible outcome:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>People work overtime to make it up. Then someone gets burned
out or the project quality gets sacrificed.</li>
<li>The deadline has to be postponed to buy us more time. Then
the project would never end. Because if you postpone once,
you will postpone again.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>
It's easy to adjust scope against a static deadline than to
adjust deadlines due to an unexpected scope change.
</p>

<p>
So let's embrace the fact that scopes are going to be changed
anyway. And you'll find stakeholders understand this fact or
accept this fact better than you do:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When the scope is expanded, stakeholders are more than happy
to do so. Because they will get more results.</li>
<li>When the scope is reduced, stakeholders are often okay with
that. After all, nobody's gonna use all of the features you
built. They just want the 20% core features that matters to
them are working well.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the other hand, stakeholders won't be that nice when it comes
to project delays. When deadline is postponed, it will almost
always affect stakeholder's stakeholder and that chain
continues. Finally one of them would not accept this delay and
you are in trouble.
</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org64ee465">
<p>
To conclude, scopes are meant to be changed, let's embrace that
fact. Furthermore, let's change the scope intentionally. Here is how
to do that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Set a deadline for your project/feature.
</p>

<p>
(I guess that's Agile frameworks like Scrum would use time
boxes. That's how they set deadlines!)
</p></li>

<li><p>
Cut scopes based on your deadline.
</p>

<p>
(I would always recommend <a href="https://open.buffer.com/product-scope/">Product Scope: The Path to a Minimum
Lovable Product</a> as a reference for how to cut scopes.)
</p></li>

<li><p>
Start doing real works.
</p>

<p>
Note down all the ideas that are out of the scope in your backlog.
Discuss them in the next plan session.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Cut scopes along the way (optional)
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, even we've cut the scope in the beginning, we would
still put too much stuffs in our plate and not being able to finish
all of them before the deadline. Then we have to cut the scope
again. The goal is to <b>always deliver values before the deadline</b>,
even these values are small.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Review and improve.
</p>

<p>
Always review our work. See how to deliver more core-related values
before the next deadline or how to define our scope better next
time.
</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1f63608" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1f63608">It is Always Easier Said Than Done</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1f63608">
<p>
After saying all of these, this methodology is still easier said than
done. Because we will always tend to add more stuffs to our plate and
this methodology is only a way to fight that temptation and get things
that really matter done.
</p>

<p>
