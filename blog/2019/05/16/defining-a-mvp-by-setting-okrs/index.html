            <h1>Defining a MVP by Setting OKRs</h1>
            <p>
When working on software-based products, it's hard to not hear about
MVP (Most Viable Product).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A minimum viable product is a product with just enough features to
satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future product
development.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-- from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum viable product - Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
But it's so much easier to understand this concept than to define your
own MVP when building a real product. (I just failed once <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2019/05/11/how-to-build-a-minimum-cms-in-an-agile-way/">to build a
MVP for a CMS</a>.) So how to really define a MVP?
</p>

<p>
I think we need to turn to the management side for some
inspirations. And I recently learned about OKR (Objectives, Key
Results) and how it helps with management:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Objectives and key results (OKR) is a framework for defining and
tracking objectives and their outcomes.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-- from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKR - Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
In this post, I'd like to explain why OKR is a good fit for manage a
MVP project and how to do it.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org01a384f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org01a384f">Why OKR is a good fit?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org01a384f">
<p>
This idea of applying OKRs for building MVPs when I was reading <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/05/07/clippings-from-measure-what-matters/#org432980a">the
chapter about Big Rocks Theory from Measure what Matters</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Engineers struggle with goal setting in two big ways.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>They hate crossing off anything they think is a good idea,</li>
<li>they habitually underestimate how long it takes to get things
done.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><b>It took discipline for people to narrow their lists to three or
four objectives for their team, but it made a huge difference.</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our OKRs became more rigorous.</li>
<li>Everybody knew what counted most.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Use a metaphor called the Big Rocks Theory (to bring focus to the
whole company)
</p>

<p>
Say you have some rocks, and a bunch of pebbles, and some sand, and
your goal is to fit as much of everything as you can into a
wide-mouth, one-gallon jar. If you start with the sand, and then the
pebbles, the jar will run out of room for all the rocks. But when
you start with the rocks, add the pebbles, and save the sand for
last, the sand fills the spaces between the rocksâ€”everything fits.
</p></li>

<li>In other words, <b>the most important things need to get done first
or they won't get done at all.</b></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgaa31f15" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgaa31f15">The Big Rocks theory matches with MVP pretty well</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaa31f15">
<p>
As you can see from the definitions above, the Big Rocks theory
is a perfect match for MVP.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The most important things that need to be done when building a
product are the rocks.</li>
<li>The less important are the pebbles.</li>
<li>The least important are the sand.</li>
<li>The process of building the product is the process of putting these
things into the jar.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given that non of us has <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/02/27/only-with-limited-resources-can-we-finish-things/">unlimited resources</a>, we have to focus on the
most important things first. And remember, <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/04/25/your-first-task-would-take-the-most-of-the-time/">your first task would take
the most of the time</a>.

<h3 id="org569e410">Engineers' struggles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org569e410">
<p>
Another good reason is that OKRs are aimed for solving the engineers'
struggles here. And these two struggles are exactly why building a MVP
is hard.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We hate crossing off anything we think is a good idea.
So we add every fancy feature to our backlog. And everything seems
to be both important and urgent. Then finally nothing can get done.</li>
<li>We habitually underestimate how long it takes to get things done.
Then we give short estimations. We let more items get into our
roadmap. Since each one of them is just another one-day of work,
right?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga596b40" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga596b40">How does OKR fix these problems?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga596b40">
<p>
By setting Objectives, we make the purpose of our Big Rocks crystally
clear.
</p>

<p>
By setting Key Results, we can tackle the two struggles above easily
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We can focus on three to five key results that really matter.
So the OKR setting process forces us to cross off things that
are less important.</li>
<li>We give clear deadlines and constantly check the progress along the
way.
So that even if we underestimate, we can get more practice on
estimation and update the progress more often.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="org11be2ea">How to define a MVP with OKRs?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org11be2ea">
<p>
I want to give an more concrete example of setting OKRs for a MVP:
let's say we are defining a MVP for the CMS product I mentioned in <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2019/05/11/how-to-build-a-minimum-cms-in-an-agile-way/">How
to build a Minimum CMS in an Agile way</a>. The OKRs for this product can
be:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Objective</b>: <i>Build an official site for the company to boost sales</i></li>
<li><b>Key Results</b>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>100% of our products are listed on the site by May 1st.</li>
<li>50 new sales opportunities are created within 3 months after the
website is launched.</li>
<li>100% of the new products developed in May can be added in time
(before May 31st).</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
With this OKR defined, our MVP's scope is set clearly. And each key
result covers one core feature we need to focus on:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The first key result covers the development of the main site. Only
if the main site is well designed and developed, can we put all of
our products there.</li>
<li>The second key result leads to the SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
work we need to do. Without a good SEO strategy, even a well
developed site cannot bring much value to the company.</li>
<li>Our last key result makes sure we won't forget the usability for
admins of this site.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Hopefully, you can get some of the idea behind defining a MVP with
OKRs with this simple example. And if you want to discuss more about
