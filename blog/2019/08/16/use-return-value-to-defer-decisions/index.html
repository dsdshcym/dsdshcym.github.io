            <h1>Use Return Value to Defer Decisions</h1>
            <p>
We need to "<a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/11/22/Clean-Architecture.html">defer architectural decisions</a>" when designing a piece of
software, <a href="https://yiming.dev/clipping/2019/08/14/use-uncertainty-to-drive-design-decisions/">so that we can switch between different options easily</a>. In
another word, deferring architectural decisions brings us design
flexibility for our application.
</p>

<p>
The same idea can be applied to the running application. By deferring
decisions of how to respond to an event, our app can become extremely
flexible. So how does a running application defer decisions it needs
to make?
</p>

<p>
There are many design patterns for solving this problem, such as
<a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans#-visitor">Visitor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans#-strategy">Strategy</a>. But this post is about a much simpler one: the
return value of our functions. As we'll see, Return Value is the
simplest, yet the most powerful tool to defer decisions for later.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org38be893" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org38be893">What is Return Value?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org38be893">
<p>
Return value is one of the first concepts I learned when I started
programming in <code>Pascal</code>. A <code>Procedure</code> would not return anything. A
<code>Function</code> would return a value.
</p>

<p>
Then I learned Ruby and Elixir. In these two languages, every line of
code would return a value. Return value is so fundamental that its
concept fades away quickly.
</p>

<p>
Until recently, I realized that the return value of a function is an
important part of its API. If you think about it, return value is the
most natural way for us to pass information aground, and only with
information, can the app make any decisions. By defining the return
value well, we can defer decision-makings in our code until the last
possible moment.
</p>

<p>
Let's see some examples:
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1432fe9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1432fe9">Tagged Tuple</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1432fe9">
<p>
The first example is a common pattern in Erlang/Elixir. Tagged Tuples
are tuples with an atom <code>:ok</code> or <code>:error</code>. The atom is a tag saying if
a function gets executed successfully or not. Take
<code>Ecto.Repo.delete/1</code> for example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elixir">case MyRepo.delete(post) do
  {:ok, struct}       -&gt; # Deleted with success
  {:error, changeset} -&gt; # Something went wrong
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
At first glance, it's too simple to be anything that's useful. But
it's actually extremely powerful.
</p>

<p>
Just think about the alternatives if we don't use a tag to indicate
the execution result:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Hard wire the error handling logic
</p>

<p>
But that means there would be no flexibility at all. If we want to
handle failed deletions differently in different places, it's
almost impossible. So this alternative is not acceptable for a
library like <code>Ecto</code>.
</p>

<p>
And if we want to deal with different failure reasons, we need to
update the <code>delete/1</code> function itself. Then it will break the
<code>Open-Close Principle</code>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Receive callbacks to handle errors
</p>

<p>
We can also add callback parameters to add some flexibility:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elixir">def delete(struct, error_callback_fun) do
  if something_goes_wrong do
    error_callback_fun.()
  end
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's an improvement compared to hard-wire the logic, but still, it
doesn't scale. If we want to handle multiple failure reasons, we
either add more callback parameters (which will make the API
unnecessarily large), or use pattern matching in
<code>error_callback_fun</code> (which is basically no different than pattern
matching the return value).
</p></li>

<li><p>
Raise exceptions when an error happens
</p>

<p>
This is one of the most common solutions in other
languages/frameworks. (Yes, I'm thinking about Ruby/Rails here.)
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">begin
  post.destroy!
rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotDestroyed
  # Something went wrong
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Due to the lack of a built-in pattern matching mechanism, the best
we can do is to return <code>true/false</code> as the indicator. But it
doesn't scale when dealing with more than two results
(succeeded/failed). And things get nastier if we want to return
some data with the result indicator.
</p>

<p>
So, I think of the exception rescuing mechanism as a pattern
matching replacement. The snippet above can be translated to:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elixir">case post.destroy! do
  true -&gt; # Deleted with success
  ActiveRecord::RecordNotDestroyed -&gt; # Something went wrong
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Though the exception way and the pattern matching way are
semantically the same, exceptions have a performance overhead, an
maintenance overhead and a cognitive overhead.
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Performance overhead</dt><dd>Raising an exception and catching it needs to go through a
separate stack and it will impact the performance more or
less.</dd>
<dt>Maintenance overhead</dt><dd>To handle a new case, we need to define a new exception
type/class. Categorize it somewhere. I can tell from my
experience, maintaining a growing number of exceptions you own
can become a nightmare.</dd>
<dt>Cognitive overhead</dt><dd><p>
Compared to the return value version, exception mechanism is a
whole new system to learn and grasp.
</p>

<p>
And learning all the exceptions defined in your app and your
dependencies is almost impossible. (A potential outcome is
that you will define a redundant exception.)
</p></dd>
</dl></li>
</ol>

<p>
To wrap the comparison above, by returning results in a tuple tagged
with an atom like <code>:ok/:error</code>, we get the most flexibility in the
simplest way. It doesn't have any performance overhead or cognitive
overhead. And to handle a new case, we just add a new type of tag in
the API definition. So the client know it needs to upgrade. The
maintenance cost is also low.

<h2 id="org3dc697c">Functional Modeling</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3dc697c">
<p>
You may still think Tagged Tuples are too simple. So let's see how
return value helps us to model our application in a functional way.
</p>

<p>
When explaining <a href="http://www.theerlangelist.com/article/spawn_or_not">why spawning a process is not always a best choice and
how to model a Blackjack game functionally</a>, Saša Jurić demonstrated
the power of return values.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Tagged Tuples
</p>

<p>
First, Saša showed us how to model a Deck in a functional way:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elixir">defmodule Blackjack.Deck do
  @cards for suit &lt;- [:spades, :hearts, :diamonds, :clubs],
             rank &lt;- [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, :jack, :queen, :king, :ace],
             do: %{suit: suit, rank: rank}

  def shuffled(), do: Enum.shuffle(@cards)

  def take([card | rest]), do: {:ok, card, rest}
  def take([]), do: {:error, :empty}
end

deck = Blackjack.Deck.shuffled()

case Blackjack.Deck.take(deck) do
  {:ok, card, transformed_deck} -&gt;
    # do something with the card and the transform deck

  {:error, :empty} -&gt;
    # deck is empty -&gt; do something else
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is just the foundation work and it uses Tagged Tuples as
usual. No big deal.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Return Side-Effects as Data to Defer Decisions</b>
</p>

<p>
The mind-blown part is how to model a round with return values in a
purely functional way.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elixir">{instructions, round} = Blackjack.Round.start([:player_1, :player_2])

# The instructions can be like this
[
  {:notify_player, :player_1, {:deal_card, %{rank: 4, suit: :hearts}}},
  {:notify_player, :player_1, {:deal_card, %{rank: 8, suit: :diamonds}}},
  {:notify_player, :player_1, :move}
]

{instructions, round} = Blackjack.Round.move(round, :player_2, :stand)

# instructions:
[
  {:notify_player, :player_1, {:winners, [:player_2]}}
  {:notify_player, :player_2, {:winners, [:player_2]}}
]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
By modeling side-effects like notifying a player as pure data, we
get more flexibility because we can pass this data around, or store
it somewhere, and decide later when and how to use this
"side-effect" data. With this kind of flexibility, we can:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Separate concerns.
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>How to make a side-effect happen</dt><dd>How to notify a player</dd>
<dt>When a side-effect needs to happen</dt><dd>When we need to notify a player</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Drive the code from different client.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Tests</li>
<li>A GenServer wrapper to add concurrency</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>
P.S. I learned a similar functional modeling technique from Saša
Jurić last year. If you are interested, you can find it at <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2019/01/29/my-advent-of-code-2018-recap/">My Advent
of Code 2018 Recap</a>
</p></li>

<li><p>
Event Bus / Event Sourcing
</p>

<p>
The struct like <code>{:notify_player, :player_1, :move}</code> reminds me of
Event Bus immediately. If we think of the <code>instructions</code> array as an
event bus, then every <code>instruction</code> is an event. So you don't need a
fancy framework, service to build an event sourcing system, just use
dead simple return values!
</p>

<p>
And the reason that Event Sourcing is getting more popular is the
same as above: <b>it helps us to defer decisions for later</b>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Message Passing / Actor Model
</p>

<p>
In addition to Event Bus, we can also understand Message Passing or
Actor Model in the same way. If we think of the <code>instructions</code> array
as an actor's message box, then every <code>instruction</code> is a message
that can be received and handled by that actor. So this kind of
functional modeling is a must-have for an Actor Model based system
like Erlang/Elixir.
</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org3c74d20" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3c74d20">Enumerating a Collection with Reducee</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3c74d20">
<p>
The last example is also the hardest one. With the flexibility return
value brings us, we can have different levels of flexibility in our
app by designing the return values (API) differently. The best example
for this is <a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/05/introducing-reducees/">how Elixir designs its <code>Enumerator</code> API</a>.
</p>

<p>
In this post, José Valim, the creator of Elixir, compared several
different solutions for enumerating a data structure. You can see how
the design becomes more flexible, loses some simplicity along the way,
and finally reaches a balance between being flexible and simple.
</p>

<p>
The final solution they chose was like this:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elixir">defmodule Reducee do
  @doc """
  Reduces the collection with the given instruction,
  accumulator and function.

  If the instruction is a `{:cont, acc}` tuple, the given
  function will be invoked with the next item and the
  accumulator.

  If the instruction is `{:halt, acc}`, it means there is
  nothing to process and the collection should halt.
  """
  def reduce([h | t], {:cont, acc}, fun) do
    reduce(t, fun.(h, acc), fun)
  end

  def reduce([], {:cont, acc}, _fun) do
    {:done, acc}
  end

  def reduce(_, {:halt, acc}, _fun) do
    {:halted, acc}
  end
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
By extracting side-effects like <code>continuing</code> or <code>halting</code> an
enumeration out as data, the <code>Reducee.reduce/3</code> is easy to understand
(compared to other solutions like <code>Iteratee</code>). And more importantly,
it's flexible enough to support almost all the functions in the
<code>Elixir.Enum</code> module.
</p>

<p>
I'd highly recommend this post if you want to know more about
different ways of data modeling and how they affect the overall API
design differently.

<h2 id="orgf2d5bd4">Wrap Up: Why Pure Functions Are Good?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf2d5bd4">
<p>
The idea of using return values to model side-effects is not new. Gary
Bernhardt talked about it in his incredible talk <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries">Boundaries</a>. The gist
is to keep side effects at the boundaries of our app, so we can have a
pure functional core.
</p>

<p>
A function is pure when it doesn't have any side-effects. How to model
that? By returning data. So we can decide what to do with this data
later. That's the beauty of functional programming.
