<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/searls/status/1075802549796638721">Justin Searls on Twitter: "Most people imagine the difficulty of
software development as knowing how to technically accomplish
something, but for me it's almost entirely about organizing
information thoughtfully and consistently."</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this statement is more than correct in our industry. The hard
part of writing good software is how to organize all the information
about our business domain in our codebases.
</p>

<p>
Because we are all humans, and we can't put all the information about
our application in our head. We need to split it into pieces and
organize them in somewhere. So that they can be more understandable to
us.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3722ffe" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3722ffe">Writing Software</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3722ffe">
<p>
As many developers have said, <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2018/06/07/livable_and_disposable_code/">"our software is a place for us to
live"</a>. Most of the development work we do, from designing to
refactoring, is to make our codebase more organized. So that we can
have a better life in this cleaner codebase.
</p>

<p>
This is especially true in the information-technology<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
sub-domain.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rails was built exactly for this sub-domain.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rails uses MVC models to organize information about
models/views/controllers in different places.</li>
<li>Rails uses ActiveRecord for modeling database related concerns. So
that
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>These concerns are well organized.</li>
<li>The concerns about how a specific database works are hidden
behind the ActiveRecord layer, and we as application developers
don't have to worry about them.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>And so on and so on.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Even for more serious areas, this idea about organizing information
thoughtfully is also important.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Data structures and algorithms are all about extracting
information about the data out.</li>
<li>Libraries are all about extracting domain unrelated information
out.</li>
<li>A well organized codebase is a prerequisite for improving
performance.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Large scale applications need <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2018/08/07/clippings-from-domain-driven-design/">Domain-Driven Design</a> to help
organize info.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Based on the assumption that building software is almost entirely
about organizing information, I did a comparison between software
development and how I organize my notes using Org mode.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0b3e1cd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0b3e1cd">Organizing Notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0b3e1cd">
<p>
After 3 years of accumulating, I now have about 18,686 entries spread
in my Org files. And I can navigate between them efficiently.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Here is how I organize them:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I have a top folder (<code>Org</code>) in my home directory, storing all my
notes files.</li>
<li><p>
In this <code>Org</code> directory, I have several <code>.org</code> files, each contains
a separate topic.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">tree ~/Org -L 1
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
~/Org

├── resume.org
├── review.org
├── rss_feed.org
├── side_projects.org
`── work.org
</pre></li>
<li><p>
In every <code>.org</code> file, I have different levels of headings:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">* Communication                                               :Communication:
** Meetings                                                       :Meetings:
*** TODO A silent meeting is worth a thousand words – Square Corner Blog – Medium :Documentation:
</pre>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This structure is basically an index that built from ground-zero:
I can now locate this link and my notes for it by just searching
for <code>communication/meetings/ silent meeting</code>.</li>
<li>With this structure, I can <a href="http://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2018/03/02/my-org-refile-workflow/">use <code>org-refile</code></a> to refile my notes
and move around between these notes very efficiently.</li>
<li>Note that I also use tags like <code>:Meetings:, :Documentation:</code> to
let me find common things in another way.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes a sub heading can belong to multiple top
headings. For example, this <i>Silent Meeting</i> article can belong
to both <code>Documentation</code> and <code>Meetings</code>.</li>
<li>In this case, I would use tags to let me connect them together.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>
And if we map these organization techniques to programming, we can get
a perfect match:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Use folders to organize note files</dt><dd>Use applications to define boundaries.</dd>
<dt>Use files for different topics</dt><dd>Use contexts/sub-domains to group classes/modules and set
boundaries in an application.</dd>
<dt>Use headings to store notes for a sub-topic</dt><dd>Use modules/classes to organize domain logic.</dd>
<dt>Use tags when a heading belongs to more than one headings</dt><dd>Multiple inheritance techniques in OOP.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The list can go on and go on. But I think you've got the idea about
the similarities between software development and notes organizing.
</p></li>
<li><p>
That being said, there are many differences between these two
activities. And they make software development much more difficult
than notes organizing:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Notes have much more clear boundaries than software domain
logic.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Oftentimes, I take notes for a blog post or book.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>And the post/book itself is already categorized by the
author/editor. I can easily see which file/heading it belongs
to.</li>
<li>Even if the post/book is not categorized, I can easily see
where it should go because I've been reading similar contents
for some time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But software doesn't work like this. Most application we work on
are somehow a green field. No one out side the team can help
us to define the broundry and no one in our team has the
experience to split these concepts before. That's why
<a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2018/08/07/clippings-from-domain-driven-design/">Domain-Driven Design</a> is a very useful methodology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Notes are only read by myself. Code is read by all team members.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>My notes are only written for myself and read by myself. I only
need to communicate the information to myself. The way I organize
my notes works well for me, but may not work for others.</li>
<li>Modern software is completely different. It requires a lot of
collaborations. Our code need to be read not only by ourselves,
but also for other team members. So the way we organize our code
should be understood and make sense to all team members.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Software need to work. Notes don't.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Though it is not as hard as organizing domain information, making
software work is still very important (sometimes more important
than organizing info). Our users won't care a broken piece of
software is how "well-organized". And it's obviously harder to
make our software work <b>and</b> well-organized at the same time.</li>
<li>And since most developers were taught to make software work,
rather than well-organized first. It's easy to be trapped to the
mindset that "we only need to make it work". This mindset plus
point 2 (communication overhead) makes the scenario worse.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>
Of course there are many other differences. But these are my top-3
reasons for why writing software is harder.

<h2 id="org3e6a750">My experience</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3e6a750">
<p>
After organizing my notes for 3 years, I can feel that sometimes I'm
"refactoring" my notes, sometimes I'm "reorganizing" my code. The
experience from notes organizing are transformed to software
development, and vice versa. So I would recommend every developer to
have a notebook and try to keep it organized.
