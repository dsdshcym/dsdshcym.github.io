<h2 id="orgfb872ba">Why this post</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfb872ba">
<p>
Complexity is the top enemy to software development. Because not only
is reducing complexity difficult, but also measuring complexity is
probably more difficult.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
There were many attempts to measure software complexity but they all
failed in some way. For example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lines of Code</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">Cyclomatic complexity</a></li>
<li>Assignments, Branches and Conditions (ABC) Metric</li>
</ul>

<p>
But this post is not about these metrics. The main focus of this post
is to discuss a "new" complexity measuring tool: our test suite (if
written well).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge24981b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge24981b">Why do we need to listen to our tests?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge24981b">
<p>
Some test advocates (including myself) often say that we should
<i>"listen to your tests!"</i> But they seldom tell us why.
</p>

<p>
I think the reason behind this statement is that <b>our tests (if
written well) is a reflection of our code's (external) complexity.</b>
But I didn't see people make this point clear. (That's why I used
<code>"new"</code> when introducing test suite as a complexity measuring tool.)
</p>

<p>
To discuss this, we need to define what are <i>well written</i> tests
first. In this post, well written tests are tests that cover all the
cases of the SUT (subject under test). Some general cases can use one
typical test point to represent or be written as property-based tests,
but they all count as only one test.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you want to test a Fibonacci function, you may write
test cases like this:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elixir">defmodule FibonacciTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use ExUnitProperties

  test "F(0) = 0" do
    assert Fibonacci.calc(0) == 0
  end

  test "F(1) = 1" do
    assert Fibonacci.calc(1) == 1
  end

  property "F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n &gt; 1" do
    check all n &lt;- positive_integer(),
              n = n + 1,
              n &lt; 1_000_000_000 do
      assert Fibonacci.calc(n) == Fibonacci.calc(n - 1) + Fibonacci.calc(n - 2)
    end
  end
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
These test cases represent the behavior of the <code>Fibonacci.calc/1</code>
function perfectly. Because they are translated directly from the
definition of Fibonacci numbers. And they matches the complexity of
the problem this function wants to solve:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The tests number is like a Cyclomatic Complexity measurement,
representing the conditions of the function.</li>
<li>The expressions in these tests are real world examples of how to
use the interface. (what parameters to pass, what outputs would be
returned, etc.)</li>
<li>The test descriptions document the intention of these different
cases.</li>
</ol>

<p>
But these tests can only represent the external complexity (behavior)
of the function. We can easily have two or more completely different
implementations (internal complexities).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
A naive implementation: 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elixir">defmodule Fibonacci do
  def calc(0), do: 0
  def calc(1), do: 1
  def calc(n) when n &gt; 1, do: calc(n - 1) + calc(n - 2)
end
</pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>
A faster implementation<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elixir">defmodule Fibonacci do
  require Integer

  def calc(0), do: 0
  def calc(1), do: 1

  def calc(n) when n &gt; 0 and Integer.is_odd(n) do
    k = div(n - 1, 2)

    f_k = calc(k)
    f_k_plus_1 = calc(k + 1)

    f_k_plus_1 * f_k_plus_1 + f_k * f_k
  end

  def calc(n) when n &gt; 0 and Integer.is_even(n) do
    k = div(n, 2)

    f_k = calc(k)
    f_k_plus_1 = calc(k + 1)

    f_k * (2 * f_k_plus_1 - f_k)
  end
end
</pre>
</div></li>
</ul>

<p>
The thing is that external complexity matters much more than internal
complexity. Here is why:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>External complexity is the only thing matters because it's the
behavior of your code/app.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It doesn't matter to other developers how you structure your code
internally, as long as it can do what it's supposed to do.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter to your user how you organize your
modules/classes internally, as long as your app can do what user
told it to do.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you have a piece of code, whose internal complexity is much
higher than its external complexity, and you have a thorough test
suite covering the external complexity, you can always rewrite the
internal and get a simpler implementation.</li>
<li>It's the combination of all the external complexities of every
modules in your application that make it complicated. That's why
<a href="http://dsdshcym.github.io/blog/2017/04/05/my-summary-for-object-oriented-programming/">OOP is all about messaging</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Furthermore, you can surely have different implementations for your
test suite as well. That means testing as a complexity measuring tool
can give us different results. How's that possible and how to
understand this issue with the thinking of complexity?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd2d5a69" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd2d5a69">Different styles of testing are just different perspectives</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd2d5a69">
<p>
Just like different people can understand the same thing in completely
different ways, testing can give us different complexity measurement
results. (And that's also why measuring complexity is so hard. Because
there are no universal and objective standards yet.)
</p>

<p>
Take <a href="https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki">Detroit-style TDD and London-style TDD</a> for example:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Detroit-style</dt><dd>Every test written is designed to maximize
regression safety. (Be as realistic as possible.
test doubles are seldom used.)</dd>
<dt>London-style</dt><dd>Focuses on communications between objects and uses
test doubles to direct the design of systems.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
They are just two ways of understanding the same SUT. Detroit-style
says the SUT needs to do stuff a, b, c. London-style says the SUT
needs to send messages to dependencies A, B, C to do stuff a, b,
c. And they are both right. They are just two different perspectives
of the same thing.
</p>

<p>
How to decide which understanding is better? Well, it depends. And I
don't have a quantitative formula for deciding which one is better
either. But at least, I know that when I write my tests first, I'm
thinking about the complexity of my code already. And that's why I
should listen to my tests. Maybe with a different view (test
strategy), I can simplify my understanding of the code by a lot.
