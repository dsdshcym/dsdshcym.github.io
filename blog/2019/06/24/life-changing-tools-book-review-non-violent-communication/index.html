            <h1>Life Changing Tools (Book Review: Nonviolent Communication)</h1>
            <p>
I've thought myself as a person with empathy for a long time. I always
try to put myself in others' shoes. No matter it's a normal chat or a
heated debate, I would try my best to understand others'
incentives. And when writing code or documentations, I would imagine
that I am the reader and review it from his perspective.
</p>

<p>
But communicating with others still feels hard (if not the hardest) to
me. At first, I found it hard to receive feedback in code reviews or
1-on-1 meetings. Then, I found it even harder to give feedback in code
reviews or 1-on-1 meetings. And even in my daily life, there are still
conflicts between me and others, especially between me and people I
love.
</p>

<p>
Often, I can understand their points. But then immediately, I feel
powerless because I don't know what to do next. I often find myself
choosing to be silent and accepting others' opinion as much as I
can. This works but I can feel the hurt this not-so-optimal behavior
brings me.
</p>

<p>
Then I started wondering, How to help them understand me better? How
to feel less defensive when receiving useful feedback? How to
communicate in a peaceful way?
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, this book helped me answer these questions. I can't wait
to apply the methodology from this book to my life and see what
changes it can bring to it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5fb9517" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5fb9517"><a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/05/08/clippings-from-nonviolent-communication/#org502ef4c">The NVC Process</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5fb9517">
<p>
The NVC Process is actually very easy to understand and remember.
</p>

<p>
First, there are four fundamental components of NVC:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Observations</dt><dd>The concrete actions we observe that affect our
well-being</dd>
<dt>Feelings</dt><dd>How we feel in relation to what we observe</dd>
<dt>Needs</dt><dd>The needs, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings</dd>
<dt>Requests</dt><dd>The concrete actions we request in order to enrich our
lives</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Then, we only need to focus on these four components in our
communications.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>expressing honestly through the four components</li>
<li>receiving empathically through the four components</li>
</ol>

<p>
Sounds simple, right? But I only realized how violent my daily
communications were after reading through this book.
</p>

<p>
I often mix my observations with judgments. I ignore my own
feelings. I suppress my needs in favor of others' requests. I give
obscure requests or even no requests.
</p>

<p>
After reading this book, I can recognize these anti-patterns and work
on fixing them. So this book gave me hope and a way to become better
at communication in the future.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org687d43f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org687d43f">Applying NVC in Real Life</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org687d43f">
<p>
That being said, recognizing anti-patterns is just the first
step. Applying NVC in our real life is still hard.
</p>

<p>
It's extremely hard to not give judgments. Even <a href="https://dsdshcym.github.io/clipping/2019/05/08/clippings-from-nonviolent-communication/#org0bddfa1">compliments are often
judgments</a>. By complimenting others with evaluations, we are basically
saying they are good and if they don't continue doing so, they will
become bad.
</p>

<p>
In a recent episode of the popular TV show Black Mirror S05 E02
Smithereens, the experts gave the CEO these two pieces
of communication advice for a crucial conversation:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>let him know you're listening</li>
<li>empathize with his position</li>
</ol>

<p>
But even equipped with them, the CEO still can't change the
conversation to a nonviolent one. Then they fallback to violent
communication patterns again.
</p>

<p>
This example demonstrates the importance of practice for learning
nonviolent communications.
</p>

<p>
And I'm learning this lesson the hard way now. Even after reading
these books about how to communicate well, I still find it hard. There
are two specific reasons for me:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>These books are all in English. But I mainly use Chinese for my
daily communication. This language gap makes my attempts look more
awkward. I guess I need to get used to it and learn how to apply
the techniques in a Chinese environment.</li>
<li>It's hard for me to break the existing communication patterns
between me and people that are more familiar and important to me. I
found it was easier to use these techniques on co-workers or even
strangers. To break the bad habits, I need to try harder.</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-orgd1d2141" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd1d2141">Read this book now</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd1d2141">
<p>
I believe this book will bring a lot of positive changes to my
life. And I would recommend you to read this book
immediately. Hopefully you will also find answers for the
communication problems you have.
