            <h1>Tech Debts and Financial Debts</h1>
            <p>
I was reading <i>Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual</i> recently. And
in Chapter 54, it talked about financial debts and why it's the most dangerous
finance mistake we can make.
</p>

<p>
I think this chapter can be applied to technical debts perfectly and help us
manage our technical finance status better.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org211b62b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org211b62b">Some common debt follies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org211b62b">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgaeb3e9e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgaeb3e9e">Saving money while holding debt</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaeb3e9e">
<p>
It doesn't make any sense on paper but actually many people are doing this both
financially and technically.
</p>

<p>
I've seen many times that developers just keep adding new features without doing
any refactoring and ignore all the technical debts in the codebase.
</p>

<p>
Most of the time, this will end pretty badly, because, as it's said in <i>Soft
Skills</i>, the (development time) interest you're paying on the debt you have is
costing you more than the interest you're making by adding features without
refactoring. And once the debt is large enough, you will find this project hard
to maintain and it will cost you a lot more time to fix these issues.
</p>

<p>
So how to avoid this? I think the best solution is: whenever we are going to add
a new feature, we pay off as many tech debts as possible (and make adding this
feature easy), then make the easy change to add this feature.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org7f7573b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7f7573b">Paying off debt in the wrong order</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7f7573b">
<p>
I've actually made many of this kind of mistakes before.
</p>

<p>
A typical example for this is that focusing on the style issues more than code
structure issues. Yes, the code style matters but what matters more is that the
code is easy to change and easy to maintain.
</p>

<p>
But what's more often is that we will ignore some larger issues since we don't
know they are there. (I'll explain more about this later.)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgfe8071e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfe8071e">Unnecessary debt</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfe8071e">
<p>
Technical debts are necessary or inevitable because we need to ship our product
and we need to borrow some time from here and there.
</p>

<p>
But sometimes people still adds many technical debts to their code bases even if
they still have enough time to pay it off.
</p>

<p>
My suggestion is to always revise your code right after you write it and see if
you can refactor it. It's always easier to pay the tech debt earlier than
later.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>

<div id="outline-container-org016268f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org016268f">Differences between Tech Debts and Financial Debts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org016268f">
<p>
Of course, Tech Debts and Financial Debts are not completely the same. I think
Tech Debts are much harder to deal with, otherwise, there would not be so many
teams that are still struggling with it.
</p>

<p>
Here are some differences that I can think of:
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd94827e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd94827e">Tech Debts are highly context dependent</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd94827e">
<p>
One of the important differences is that tech debts are highly <b>context
dependent</b>. Unlike financial debts (a debt is always a negative number in your
ledger), a tech debt in a code base may not be a debt in another code base.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd8fdaa6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd8fdaa6">Tech Debts will not cost you immediately</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd8fdaa6">
<p>
Another difference I can think of is that tech debts will not cost you
immediately (like a credit card debt), but it will accumulate or propagate other
tech debts and finally break out and ruin your whole project one day.
</p>

<p>
Since it will not cost you immediately, you will hardly notice it when it's easy
to fix it. Until you notice it, it might already be too late.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org515926b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org515926b">Tech Debts are hard to measure or quantify</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org515926b">
<p>
The last and the biggest difference I think is that tech debts are really hard
to measure. Unlike financial debts, it's nearly impossible to say that this
project still owes X hours or Y days as its tech debt.
</p>

<p>
Since it's hard to measure, it's hard to say whether a refactoring is paying off
the tech debts or adding the tech debts.
</p>

<p>
The best we can do for now is to use some statistic analytic tools<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> to help us
measure it, but it's not always accurate. And we still need more experiences and
knowledge on tech debts to recognize them and eliminate these code smells.
