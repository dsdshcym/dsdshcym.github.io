            <h1>Similarities between TDD and Management</h1>
            <p>
The more I learn about management, the more similarities I find
between management and software development. (which makes sense
because they are just different ways to solve problems after all)
</p>

<p>
In today's post, I want to show you the similarities between
Test-Driven Development (TDD) and meeting arrangement.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org2ad7d53" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2ad7d53">How to do TDD</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2ad7d53">
<p>
Let's first see how we do TDD in the traditional Red/Green/Refactor
cycle.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<b>Red</b>
</p>

<p>
In this phase, we write a test with detailed description to define
the problem we need to solve.
</p>

<p>
With this well written test, we define our <b>goal</b> for our next
development cycle.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Green</b>
</p>

<p>
Then we try to write minimal code to turn the test to green.
</p>

<p>
We emphasize on <i>minimal code</i> because it's the only way to keep
things simple. By keeping things simple, we let future requirements
push us to more complexities<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Refactor</b>
</p>

<p>
After passing a test, we looked back to our code and test
immediately and see if there's anything we can refactor.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
With this process in my mind, I found that when we were unconsciously
applying the same discipline to our management process, things work
better.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgdb2ae24" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdb2ae24">How to arrange a meeting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdb2ae24">
<p>
So, How do we arrange a meeting at Ekohe?
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<b>Define the problem</b>
</p>

<p>
First, we try to define the problem we have right now.
</p>

<p>
During this phase, we are not supposed to talk about any potential
solutions.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> Because they would easily misguide the topic of
our discussion and make people confused about why we are arranging
this meeting.
</p>

<p>
It's just like writing a test that's not coupled to our
implementation. With the implementation in our mind, it's much
harder to do so.
</p>

<p>
I remembered once I proposed to do our daily stand-up over Slack (a
potential solution), because I thought we were not communicating
about our projects well enough (the problem). Then I got asked
"Let's not talk about using Slack or not now. What's the real
problem behind this?" After that we dug deeper together and found
the real problem.
</p>

<p>
In a word, the whole purpose of this phase is to set the <b>goal</b> for
the meeting. Every meeting should have a clear goal (what problem
this meeting needs to solve), otherwise, it's just a waste of time.
(Or maybe your problem doesn't need a meeting to solve at all.)
</p>

<p>
This goal is a <i>test</i> that can keep us focused and help us review
our solution in a clearer way.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Find a solution</b>
</p>

<p>
After the goal was set, we find the right person to join the
meeting and try to find a solution together.
</p>

<p>
We all know that meeting can be very time-consuming sometimes.
Especially when we get the wrong group of people into a meeting, we
are basically wasting a lot of valuable working hours by achieving
nothing.
</p>

<p>
So it's important to find the right person based on the goals we
set.
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Is it a management problem?</dt><dd>Find the PM.</dd>
<dt>Is it a technical issue?</dt><dd>Find the technical leader.</dd>
<dt>Is it a spec misunderstanding?</dt><dd>Talk to the client and find what they really want.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Just like the <i>green</i> phase, we try to keep things simple, just
solve the problem in our hand right now, and always defer
complexities for later.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>Try to improve</b>
</p>

<p>
Finally, after the solution is deployed, we take a look back at the
solution from time to time, and see if we can find ways to improve.
</p>

<p>
We believe <b>there is always more than one way to solve a problem.</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>The only constant in this world is change.</i> Everything around us
is constantly changing.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>A solution that work today may not work tomorrow.</dt><dd>That's why we need to look back from time to time and check if
the solution is still working as expected.</dd>
<dt>We will never know less than we do right now</dt><dd>We'll always get more information and feedback for our
problem/solution later. And with the new information, we can
always improve our solution to fit the new context.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
So it's important for us to gather feedback and always try to
improve (<i>refactor</i>).
</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge5b1213" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge5b1213">They are almost the same</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge5b1213">
<p>
You may say there are still some differences between these two
processes, like refactoring v.s. improvements. But the basic ideas and
core principles are the same:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Set clear goals</b> at first</li>
<li>Try to find the simplest solution</li>
<li><b>Gather feedback</b> and improve</li>
</ol>

<p>
No matter we are TDDing or arranging a meeting, we are both trying to
solve a problem (technical or human-related). So it's natural that
they share some similarities. And I believe there can be a meta way to
follow here. Maybe I can also look back at this thought from time to
time and see what it can be improved.
