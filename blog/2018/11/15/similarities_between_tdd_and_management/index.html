            <h1>Similarities between TDD and Management</h1>
            <p>
Recently, I started transitioning into more of a management role (more
code review, hiring, and team building related work). I felt a bit
intimidating at first because I thought I would not be able to use my
development skills anymore.
</p>

<p>
But the more I learn about management, the more similarities I find
between management and software development. Even more fascinating, I
find that I can apply the same discipline to the management process as
I did to my coding process, and it can help me to do my work better.
</p>

<p>
In today's post, I want to show you an example of the similarities
between Test-Driven Development (TDD) and meeting
arrangement. Hopefully, you can get a grasp of how they are related
and how to apply the same discipline from development to management.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgca03546" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgca03546">What is TDD and how do we do it?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgca03546">
<p>
TDD is a development approach where tests are written before the
development of a feature. This is done in increments so that that only
enough code necessary to pass the tests are written. The test drives
the production code, rather than the other way around. This forces
developers to be agile and to focus on the requirements of the feature
before writing any code, ultimately resulting in fewer bugs.
</p>

<p>
Practicing TDD in the traditional Red/Green/Refactor cycle.
</p>

<p>
The Red/Green/Refactor cycle essentially defines the steps of TDD,
where red represents a "failing test" and green represents a "passing
test."
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<b>Red</b>
</p>

<p>
In this step, we write a test with detailed description to define
the problem we need to solve. Here, we define the specifications
for the feature we want to develop and create tests for each of and
only the functionalities of the feature.
</p>

<p>
At this stage, the written tests should fail as to ensure that it's
not a false positive or false negative.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>false positives</dt><dd>tests that are passing but not because of our changes. So we
make sure our tests are red before we make any changes</dd>
<dt>false negatives</dt><dd>tests that are failing but are not caused by the part we want
to test. (maybe we made a mistake in our test or something
similar) So we make sure we get the expected failing message
before we make changes.</dd>
</dl></li>

<li><p>
<b>Green</b>
</p>

<p>
Then we write just enough code to pass the test and turn it green.
</p>

<p>
We emphasize minimal code because it's the only way to keep things
simple. By keeping things simple, we maintain readability which
helps the refactoring process and minimizes bugs. We should focus
on coding what's required for this specific functionality and only
let future requirements push us towards more complexities.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Refactor</b>
</p>

<p>
After passing a test, we review our code and see if there's
anything we can refactor.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
With this process in mind, I realized that when we were unconsciously
applying the same discipline to our management process, things work
better.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> For example, we could use the TDD approach to organize a
meeting.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orga686d97" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga686d97">How to arrange a meeting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga686d97">
<p>
So, How do we arrange a meeting at Ekohe?
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<b>What's the problem?</b>
</p>

<p>
First, we define the problem that requires a meeting and identify
the people we need to participate in the meeting to solve the
problem
</p>

<p>
At this point, we don't bring up any potential solutions<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>,
because that would divert our focus and confuse people about why
it's necessary to have a meeting in the first place.
</p>

<p>
This is just like writing a test that's not tied to our
implementation. It's much harder to develop a test when we think
about writing production code at the same time.
</p>

<p>
I remembered once I thought we were not communicating enough about
our projects (the problem), and I suggested we do our daily
stand-up over Slack (a potential solution). Then I was asked,
"What's the real problem behind this?" After that we dug deeper
together and found the real problem.
</p>

<p>
Basically, the whole purpose of this phase is to set the goal for
the meeting; otherwise, it's just a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
Defining the goal is the test that can keep us focused and help us
figure our solution in a better way.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Find a solution</b>
</p>

<p>
After defining the problem, we can now go about finding potential
solutions and identifying the appropriate people with whom we could
work to solve the issue.
</p>

<p>
It's important that we invite only the people necessary to solve
the problem.
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Is it a management problem?</dt><dd>Find the PM.</dd>
<dt>Is it a technical issue?</dt><dd>Find the technical leader.</dd>
<dt>Is it a spec misunderstanding?</dt><dd>Talk to the client and find what they really want.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It's equally important that the meeting covers only the set topic
of the problem and that it doesnâ€™t last too long. This simplifies
the problem-solving process and maximizes efficiency, just as
writing minimal code to pass tests written in the red phase helps
keeps things simple.
</p>

<p>
Just as in the green phase, we solve only the problem at hand and
defer complexities to a later time.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>Assess and adapt the solution</b>
</p>

<p>
Once we implement the solution, we take a look back and see if it
really solved the problem and if it needs any adjustments.
</p>

<p>
At Ekohe, we believe <b>there is always more than one way to solve a
problem.</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>The only constant in this world is change.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>A solution that work today may not work tomorrow.</dt><dd>That's why we need to look back from time to time and check if
the solution is still working as expected.</dd>
<dt>We will never know less than we do today.</dt><dd>With the new feedback and information, we can adapt our
solution if necessary.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
So it's important for us to gather feedback and always try to
improve (<i>refactor</i>).
</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgecd49e0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgecd49e0">They are almost the same</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgecd49e0">
<p>
You may say there are still some differences between these two
processes, like refactoring v.s. improvements. But the basic ideas and
core principles are the same:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Set clear goals / specifications</b></li>
<li>Find the simplest solution</li>
<li><b>Gather feedback</b> and improve</li>
</ol>

<p>
Whether we are TDDing or arranging a meeting, we are just trying to
solve a problem (technical or human-related). So it's natural that
they share some similarities. And I believe there can be a meta way to
follow here. Maybe I can also look back at this thought from time to
time and see what it can be improved.
