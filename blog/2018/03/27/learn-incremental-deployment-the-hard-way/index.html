            <h1>Learn Incremental Deployment the Hard Way</h1>
            <p>
I failed to deploy two big features in the past two years. I want to
discuss why I failed them and what I think the best way to finish
them.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgda22ff0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgda22ff0">2 Failed Features</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgda22ff0">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2583b60" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2583b60"><a id="ID-F918D834-B7FA-42D4-8A9A-6453F52AC0A9"></a>Extract App Configurations to Environment Variables</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2583b60">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0d81684" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0d81684">Context</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0d81684">
<p>
We have many app configurations (e.g. 3-rd party service
configurations like AWS S3, app behavior configurations like host
name). We were storing these configurations in files (like a normal
Rails app would normally do). In the config files, we have different
values for different environment (development/staging/production).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0b504c3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0b504c3">Reason for refactoring</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0b504c3">
<p>
And then we migrated to using Docker/Kubernetes for deployments. We
want to setup more staging environments for different teams to test
independent features.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf832745" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf832745">The Plan</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf832745">
<p>
So we decided to extract these configuration values into environment
variables.
</p>

<p>
I thought this was an easy change so I kept all the changes in a
single feature branch. But it turned out to be a silly decision.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1c0a140" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1c0a140">Issues</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1c0a140">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It's a ton of work to review. Although it's almost just replacing
the hard-coded value with a call to <code>ENV</code> , it's the most hard to
review type of merge requests because it needs reviewer to verify
if there are any typos instead of logic defects.</li>
<li>We don't have any tests coverage for most of the features. So
it's harder to know if these actually working or not. We have to
deploy them to staging or even production to know that.</li>
<li>I took two-month vacation when I finished the code changes. But
other developers didn't deploy these changes nor tested
them. After I got back, I had to rebase the feature branch to
catch the newest changes and deal with newly added
configurations.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb5eaeb3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb5eaeb3">Results</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb5eaeb3">
<p>
Of course things went completely wrong after I merged this branch
and tested them on staging. Even the homepage had some issues. We
had to go back and forth to find the issue and fix it, test it
again. Finally, it took us almost 3 months to finish this
refactoring.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga616fc2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga616fc2">Merge an API service into the main App</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga616fc2">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org874f004" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org874f004">Context</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org874f004">
<p>
We have two apps running, one of them is the web interface (responds
to HTML requests), another one is the API interface (responds to
JSON requests).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgfeb99f5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgfeb99f5">Reason for refactoring</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfeb99f5">
<p>
They share almost the same behaviour, except the view templates are
different. Whenever we need to add or modify a piece of logic, we
need to do it twice.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgda1be30" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgda1be30">The Plan</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgda1be30">
<p>
So we decided to merge these two apps and leverage Rails' powerful
<code>respond_to</code> method.
</p>

<p>
Since I have the experience from last time (<a href="#org2583b60">Extract Feature Toggles
to Environment Variables</a>), I decided to do it one controller by one
controller.
</p>

<p>
It started pretty well: I separated them into different branches, so
that they can be tested and merged independently. I planed to test
and deploy migrated APIs and migrate other APIs at the same time.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org56ead95" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org56ead95">Issues</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org56ead95">
<p>
But then bad things happened in our process:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>My manager took several weeks off for vacation. And I took
several weeks off for vacation after he got back. We didn't
merge/deploy any of these changes in these weeks.</li>
<li>Another developer was still developing new features in the
meantime. So that when I got back from the vacation, I had more
things to sync.</li>
<li>We didn't have any integration tests for our APIs. Which meant I
also needed to add them when I migrated them into the web
app. (But I was not sure if these tests were even correct at
all.)</li>
<li><p>
The client (mobile apps) for this API is maintained by our
clients in a different timezone (Yes, we are only responsible for
the web part and the API). They didn't provide any test apps for
us to test the migrated API until I migrated all of them.
</p>

<p>
Of course things went wrong when all these bad things came together.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Since my manager was off, I finished all the APIs without
deploying anything. (Things started to go off the rails from this
decision.)</li>
<li>The client team moved really slow. I received the test app weeks
after I finished the APIs. And another dev had already added new
features to existing old APIs.</li>
<li>In our old API App, we had handlers for both <code>.api</code> and <code>.json</code>
formats. Since I didn't have any integration tests nor an test
app. I had to re-implement both of them, which actually added
some garbage code to our web app.</li>
<li>The newly added tests didn't provide me with enough confidence so
I had to test the new APIs with a staging app. But then the
controllers had dependencies on each other due to the business
logic on the client side. (I had to login to test all the other
controllers.)</li>
<li>Since the client team was in a different timezone, I had to wait
for a day for their feedback on the API specifications, which
made things much harder.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org3ce0e85" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3ce0e85">Results</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3ce0e85">
<p>
Finally, I had to merge all the changes into one branch and handed
over the testing phase to my manage (who's in the same timezone as
the client team), and let them test the new APIs. This means my plan
to incrementally deploy these new APIs completely failed.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf489f55" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf489f55">Common Issues</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf489f55">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9efd278" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9efd278">No Tests</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9efd278">
<p>
These two refactorings both started without any integration test
coverage. And testing them on staging/production took a lot of
time. Without the confidence provided by integration tests, I was
always afraid that some changes would break something when deploy.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org292fe5e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org292fe5e">Vocations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org292fe5e">
<p>
I both took vocation during the development of these two
refactorings. I should've at least deployed what I'd finished and
tested them out. So that the changes wouldn't get outdated after my
vocation.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org90b2971" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org90b2971">Huge Steps</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org90b2971">
<p>
And the most important issue was that I wanted to take a huge step to
finish these tasks once and for all, instead of breaking down them
into smaller tasks (while these two tasks could be easily separated
into sub-tasks by nature). This is against the spirit of Agile and
kind of like waterfall.
</p>

<p>
I ran into many unexpected problems when I deployed the huge
changesets. I would gain more experiences dealing with these problems
if I took smaller steps and tried to learn from each steps.
</p>
</div>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-org26e37ca" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org26e37ca">Incremental Deployment: the Only Way to Deploy Large Feature Changes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org26e37ca">
<p>
I think the only way to deploy this kind of large changesets is
breaking them down into smaller changesets and deploy them
incrementally. Even if I have a better test coverage, I would still
choose this incremental strategy. I think <b>taking small steps</b> and
<b>getting feedback from each step</b> are the core idea of Agile and
Continuous Integration. If I always keep the system deployable and
runnable, add small refactorings step by step, any huge tasks can be
taken down easily.
</p>

<p>
I'll take the above two examples and explain how I would deploy them,
and also give a template for this kind of changes.

<li>Figure out the dependencies between controllers to decide the order

<ol class="org-ol">

<h2 id="orgf480f37">Summary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf480f37">
<p>
The final template is super simple and I think this was what I was
doing when I tried to implemented the mentioned refactorings. But due
to many complex reasons, I was doing it completely wrong. I guess I
just learned this idea of incremental deployment the hard way from
these real cases.
