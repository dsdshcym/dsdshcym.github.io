<h1>Why did I switch to Arch Linux</h1>
<p>
I installed Arch Linux on my macbook during the final exam week. :)
</p>

<p>
And here is why I decided to do this.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb4296e8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb4296e8">Why not use OS X anymore?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb4296e8">
<p>
OS X is a great operating system. And I really appreaciate it for leading me
into the UNIX world in the last one and a half years. But it's just not for me
anymore. The reasons are listed below:
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb081444" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb081444">Emacs for OS X is much slower than Emacs for Linux.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb081444">
<p>
I did some tests in a virtual machine before I repartition my disk. And I
just found that even in a virtual machine, whose performance is worse for
sure, Emacs runs better than on OS X. Scrolling is smoother, magit
responds much faster, everything just works faster.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org97b42a6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org97b42a6">i3 - the tiling window manager</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org97b42a6">
<p>
The main point of these needs (tiling window manager and fullscreen app) is
to make the best use of my little 13 inch screen.
</p>

<p>
There is no perfect window manager on OS X. I've tried almost every window
manager for OS X. But none of them can make me completely comfortable. Though
I have to admit that I haven't used any kind of window manager until I
started using OS X, my eager for a better tiling window manager grows day by
day.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Window size control
</p>

<p>
Due to the control of Apple to it's OS's desktop environment. There are few
things we can do to control our windows except using some poor assistant APIs
to resize or move windows. You can even see the window resize animations
showed in several steps. So the performance is not good too. And some apps,
Wechat for example, have a minimal window size constraint, so it can't be
"tiled" into a container. It's definitely a pain to watch it to be resized
into a size you want it to be but struggle back in the next second.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Switch between windows
</p>

<p>
Another constraint is I can hardly use only my keyboard to move between
different windows in the same space. Some window manager apps on OS X can
let me to do this using keyboard shortcuts, but I can hardly switch to
Wechat (Yeah, Wechat, you again) or some other apps successfully due to
its special implementation of app window. I need to use spotlight or
other keyboard shortcuts (binded using Karabiner) to switch to it. So I
have three different ways to switch between apps, and it's even too
confusing for me sometimes.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Switch between spaces
</p>

<p>
The last constraint of OS X's desktop environment is the differentiation
between Spaces and Full Screen Apps. I can use some shortcuts to switch
between different spaces, but I can't switch to a fullscreen app. For example
I can switch to Space 1 using C-1, but if I have a fullscreen Chrome window
after space 2, I can't switch to it using C-3. This feature can be done using
TotalSpaces2. But I need to spend an extra 60 Yuan or so to buy this app,
find a way to work around the SIP feature in El Capitan and write a ruby
script to switch to make the fullscreen app works like a Space.
</p></li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-orge251c74" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge251c74">I barely need to use apps other than Emacs, web browser and Telegram</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge251c74">
<p>
This fact makes OS X too heavy to me. And these three apps all work well on
Linux. So I thought I can install Arch Linux on my laptop and use apps that I
really need.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org12b28db" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org12b28db">What I miss for OS X</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org12b28db">
</div><div id="outline-container-orgbf24fc7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbf24fc7">Time Machine</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbf24fc7">
<p>
This is a really useful feature. I can plug on my disk and setup only once then
it will take care of all my files by backing up them every day or hour. And I
can just forget about it. When I need to find something back, I just ask it for
them and it will never let me down.
</p>

<p>
I still can't find something works like Time Machine on Linux. But I believe in
the Linux world there must be some similar or even better solutions.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge4df4c5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge4df4c5">Dictionary</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge4df4c5">
<p>
OS X has a wonderful default dictionary. And I can use it through spotlight,
three-finger tapping and even Emacs (osx-dictionary mode).
</p>

<p>
I switch to goldendict on Linux. It works well actually since I have some
dictionaries on my Android Phone. But it seems not have a command line version.
So I still need to find a way to make it work in Emacs.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgfed5112" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfed5112">Fonts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfed5112">
<p>
The default fonts on OS X (San Francisco and PingFang) are pretty good. And I
can only get kind of font rendering effects on Arch now using Source Han Sans
CJK fonts. There are still some words in Emacs and Chrome looks pretty bad. Some
Simple Chinese words are using Source Han Sans TC fonts or even Japanese fonts,
which are really wired.
